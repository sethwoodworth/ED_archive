[Monday:15:55:41] Ben: So, funny story.
[Monday:15:56:07] Ben: Apparently your publishers or someone contacted my vice principal at my school to tell them what had happened.
[Monday:15:56:22] Ben: (This is serious, don't ignore it like you've been ignoring me the last 3 days : ])
[Monday:15:57:28] Ioji: I don't have much time lately
[Monday:15:57:33] Ben: oh.
[Monday:15:57:33] Ben: okay.
[Monday:15:57:40] Ben: can I bring marballz in?
[Monday:15:57:47] Ioji: why
[Monday:15:57:54] Ben: He's curious of what's going on.
[Monday:15:58:18] Ben: If you don't want that that's fine.
[Monday:15:58:21] Ben: Anyway.
[Monday:15:58:29] Ben: My mother actually is furious with you. :(
[Monday:15:58:34] Ioji: haha
[Monday:15:58:43] Ioji: weird, she should be furios with you actually
[Monday:15:59:01] Ben: She runs many high profile websites and has been for many years, she says she actually can sue you for stalking a minor. Well not you, your publishers.
[Monday:15:59:12] Ioji: ahahahahah
[Monday:15:59:14] Ben: I also told her about the raid, she agrees that you reacted wrongly.
[Monday:15:59:15] Ioji: yeah right.
[Monday:15:59:33] Ioji: she's protecting you? you should show her the picture you guys posted.
[Monday:15:59:39] Ben: I'd rather not.
[Monday:15:59:43] Ben: No one should have to see the pain series.
[Monday:15:59:56] Ben: I told her people were posting offensive images, and instead of deleting the posts and banning them you closed the site for two days and called it damage to your site.
[Monday:16:00:21] Ioji: did you tell her that it was you leading the "raid"
[Monday:16:00:22] Ioji: ?
[Monday:16:00:28] Ben: But it wasn't ^_____________^
[Monday:16:00:28] Ioji: and that you got your sister into it?
[Monday:16:00:52] Ben: she's upset that she has to deal with stupid things like this. She agrees that the internet =/= serious business. She's wondeful.
[Monday:16:00:54] Ben: woderful.
[Monday:16:01:01] Ben: wonderful. Something's wrong today.
[Monday:16:01:05] Ben: Anyway.
[Monday:16:01:39] Ben: The only thing she's upset at me for is disclosing where I go to school
[Monday:16:01:48] Ioji: well you, your mom and your sister can organize all the spamming raids you want. just don't do it on a website visited by kids.
[Monday:16:02:09] Ioji: oh, so she's ok with all the rest? you beeing affilated with a bunch of losers?
[Monday:16:02:19] Ben: She won't sue because frankly she doesn't want to deal with stupid things like this.
[Monday:16:02:40] Ben: She understands how internet communities work. I'd give an example of her greatest acheivement, but she told me not to tell you. :)
[Monday:16:02:54] Ben: Told me to not give out information on the internet anymore to people I can't trust.
[Monday:16:02:59] Ben: : )
[Monday:16:03:14] Ioji: you're the people I can't trust Ben.
[Monday:16:03:24] Ioji: and sincerly, I don't have a clue why you act like that
[Monday:16:03:28] Ioji: makes no sense to me.
[Monday:16:03:35] Ben: I didn't actually attack your site, you claimed I did and took it to my vice principal at my highschool for some reason
[Monday:16:03:47] Ben: well your publishers did
[Monday:16:03:59] Ben: and oddly enough, a week after this all happened
[Monday:16:04:45] Ben: I'm not sure why you're still convinced I did it, you even said yourself you believed I didn't do it after frivolous arguing
[Monday:16:05:10] Ioji: well, actually I got proofs
[Monday:16:05:11] Ben: And I'm not associated with ED :  )
[Monday:16:05:21] Ioji: haha, yes Ben. keep saying that.
[Monday:16:05:25] Ben: okay!
[Monday:16:05:33] Ben: I shall keep professing the truth! :>
[Monday:16:06:14] Ben: I was actually trying to earn your trust back, the trust I shouldn't have even lost, but I see it's not even worth it now
[Monday:16:06:26] Ben: My mom thinks you're not right in the head ^___________________^
[Monday:16:06:45] Ioji: you were trying to earn my trust back to organize another raid?
[Monday:16:07:17] Ben: by not talking about it and simply trying to return to the norm
[Monday:16:08:13] Ioji: and what did you think I would do?
[Monday:16:09:03] Ben: well, the last time I talked to you you said you believed it wasn't me and believed it was my sister so I thought things were cool
[Monday:16:09:19] Ben: I think you can understand why I thought everything was fine again
[Monday:16:09:23] Ioji: <a'Pokchu> GUYS 
<a'Pokchu> GUYS 
<a'Pokchu> GUYS 
<a'Pokchu> GUYS 
<a'Pokchu> during the warbears raid, people only spammed porn right
[Monday:16:09:46] Ben: hello
[Monday:16:09:56] Ben: a'Pokchu?
[Monday:16:10:26] Ben: impersonator Ioji :)
[Monday:16:11:00] Ben: so wait, why did you paste that?
[Monday:16:11:03] Ioji: hehe
[Monday:16:11:07] Ioji: yes right.
[Monday:16:11:17] Ioji: and he was listening to all our conversations, yes?
[Monday:16:11:23] Ioji: about the lawyers? mh?
[Monday:16:11:30] Ioji: the mistical magical impersonator
[Monday:16:12:04] Ben: I don't really care about making you believe me anymore, it doesn't matter to me. :)
[Monday:16:12:12] Ben: My mom told me not to go back to Warbears anyway.
[Monday:16:12:37] Ioji: don't worry, she won't know the terrible truth about his child : p
[Monday:16:12:43] Ioji: but you should really stop doing these things
[Monday:16:12:57] Ioji: it's a waste of time. maybe worth a couple of laughs, but that's it
[Monday:16:13:04] Ben: I didn't actually do it
[Monday:16:13:14] Ioji: being involved with them
[Monday:16:13:14] Ben: I don't care that you think otherwise really
[Monday:16:13:34] Ioji: because you reached the bottom and you can't prove anymore that you're innocent
[Monday:16:13:34] Ben: and although it wasn't me, reading it now
[Monday:16:13:56] Ben: it is actually very funny. all of it. Now that I free myself of the need to earn your trust, I realize how hilarious this entire situation is.
[Monday:16:14:33] Ben: The comment about how they were possessed by demons was extroadinarily rich Ioji.
[Monday:16:14:49] Ioji: they probably are. who knows.
[Monday:16:14:59] Ben: I don't think demons are real. :)
[Monday:16:15:12] Ioji: guess you'll find out when you die
[Monday:16:15:25] Ben: I'm trying to contain my laughter.
[Monday:16:15:31] Ben: Oh should I? Oh should I...
[Monday:16:16:21] Ben: There's no such thing as demons, there's no evidence to support it, so I don't believe it's real. :D
[Monday:16:16:22] Ioji: ok, tell them also that I think that watching those pics is sick
[Monday:16:16:29] Ben: oh I agree the pics were sick
[Monday:16:17:36] Ben: no doubt about it
[Monday:16:17:50] Ben: I'm not going to tell them because I'm not associates with them
[Monday:16:17:59] Ioji: and what do you think about posting them in a 9yo girl forum?
[Monday:16:18:07] Ioji: what does your mother thinks about it?
[Monday:16:18:39] Ben: well, I'm sure if she saw the picture she'd be horrified that the girl saw it
[Monday:16:18:53] Ben: actually she'd be horrified anyone saw it
[Monday:16:19:01] Ben: the pain series is an infinity of eye sores
[Monday:16:19:36] Ben: she'd probably say "Ugh...that's...that's just awful." and wish I hadn't shown her it
[Monday:16:20:21] Ben: she doesn't know about that part (probably because it's not relevant to your publishers stalking me).
[Monday:16:20:42] Ioji: actually I think it is
[Monday:16:21:22] Ben: not her specifically
[Monday:16:21:50] Ioji: anyway, have fun with your friends
[Monday:16:22:13] Ben: Whaaatever. :)
[Monday:16:22:33] Ben: If you couldn't tell already, I'm an atheist.
[Monday:16:23:11] Ioji: and?
[Monday:16:23:21] Ben: Nothing. 
[Monday:16:23:55] Ioji: what do you want me to say about it? "you're going to hell" or something?
[Monday:16:24:13] Ioji: grow up Ben
[Monday:16:24:20] Ioji: oh. and format your pc ; )
[Monday:16:24:25] Ben: No need to format it.
[Monday:16:24:51] Ioji: I was being sarcastic
[Monday:16:25:00] Ben: Couldn't tell.
[Monday:16:26:08] Ben: Welp, just thought I'd let you know that there are no legal consequences.
[Monday:16:26:44] Ben: And that Advergamer can actually be sued. We won't since this is all stupid, but still.
[Monday:16:28:06] Ioji: we're not the bad guys here, so..
[Monday:16:28:46] Ben: Just the legal truth. :)
[Monday:16:29:29] Ioji: if they had to investigate they would get to you anyway
[Monday:16:29:44] Ioji: you know that.
[Monday:16:29:57] Ben: none of this matters. :)
[Monday:16:30:46] Ben: I'm going to go actually live my life and not deal with people who cry when their internet website is attacked by five trolls. And by the way, you played into their hands. 
[Monday:16:31:03] Ioji: hahah
[Monday:16:31:20] Ioji: have a good life then
[Monday:16:31:25] Ben: Mhm. :)
[Monday:16:32:58] Ioji: I've been trolling you for hours at the point you didn't even answer the phone and you call me defeated? ahahah : D
