Reaction Strip
The very easiest form of [[exploitable]] in existence. '''Reaction strips''' usually consist of two comedically different facial expressions separated by a blank space in which to MSPaint a picture of one's choice, but some bypass even this element of [[original content]] and require only the addition of text.

Reaction strips are very funny when executed well, an internet phenomenon believed by some to be mythical.
