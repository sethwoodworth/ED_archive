Rocky Lockridge
Rocky Lockridge was a [[homeless]], [[typical|methamphetamine addicted and Super Featherweight boxing champion]] black person who appeared on the A & E's show, "Intervention", nobody watched this show except for [[emo]]s and [[fag]]s who like hearing sad stories on television just to feel even [[moar]] depressed. The show was about making people [[BAWWWWWW]] and [[incest|bringing families together]] to help the crackhead who is addicted to some [[drug|shit]].

==The Best Cry Ever==

On season 7, Rocky Lockridge made his internet fame debut by giving [[anon]] one of the most [[lulz]]y and [[epic]] cryings ever in history,  The cry of knowing [[ALL CAPS|SOMEONE STILL LOVES HIM]] ... [[ALL CAPS|SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN IN HIS HEART]], makes it in one of the most beautiful moments on the internets EVER.
