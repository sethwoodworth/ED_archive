Holy crap my facebook comments are going nuts since I posted about not winning.|@4bit4, June 23 via Twitter|
Checking out the canvasses of people I’d never heard of who won.|@4bit4, June 24 via Twitter|
man, a couple of ex-cubies have unfriended me already. Kinda sad.|@4bit4, June 24 via Twitter| 
FIRST I DIDN’T WIN A CUBE, THEN MY DOG FARTS ON ME!!!!11!! I’m never going to the sandbox again and I hate everyone /drama|@4bit4, June 25 via Twitter|
@sandbarmark for the record, the people who won that didn’t do jack belittle us that busted our butts & didn’t win. I’m cool anyway though|@4bit4, June 26 via Twitter|
@sandbarmark agreed, but based on the stated criteria for winning, it doesn’t add up. Regardless, people need to get over it.|@4bit4, June 26 via Twitter|
RT @gunandagirl @thehypercube Love to see a discount from Nissan too for the other non-winners. The Cube still makes sense for us to buy.|@ben3PO, June 26 via Twitter|
@CubicLuv You’re joking right? You put up billboards..you’re the ultimate description of a marketing whore..|@dogmeat78, June 24 via Twitter|
was under the impression that the contest was about creativity and individuality, not corporate ad-whoring media campaigns|@euthanaut, June 24 via Twitter|
@jestdepsey my cardboard cube, tho posted, never got noticed. And it was out there before…u know. And I worked hard painting it!|@iggabod, June 27 via Twitter|
@PhilKnudson lots followed me. I followed back. tried to get to know them. but well, you know that story. “plastic people!”|@iggabod, June 27 via Twitter|
@jestdempsey but all along we were not meant to win. no matter what we did. They had their plans.|@iggabod, June 27 via Twitter|
@jestdempsey many are bitter. it will pass..but it’s gotta be pointed in the right direction.|@iggabod, June 27 via Twitter|
I’m happy for all of the winners, but bummed out for me.|@Kooken1, June 25 via Twitter|
is taking a break from twitter…|Kooken1, June 26 via Twitter|
@euthanaut Yeah, I thought it was about creativity, too. FML.|@lifeofjames, June 24 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden Just read your post at Cubeless…I agree with ALL of your assessments. Peace.|@lifeofjames, June 26 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden @gunandagirl I have to admit I unfollowed a bunch of cube winners i never had interaction with. *shrug*|@lifeofjames, June 27 via Twitter|
@CJulie75 No, apparently a lot of missed that. Should’ve worked on growing dreads instead. That & my modeling portfolio.|@mackb1991, June 26 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden Anytime. Good read and analysis of the whole thing. I don’t regret participating, just feel like some bait & switch happened|@mackb1991, June 26 via Twitter|
@SunnyCrittenden I think that Cubeless.ca is quite possibly the best thing 2 come out of the Hypercube contest. Honest, emotional & real…|@mackb1991, June 27 via Twitter|
@jestdempsey maybe it’s my age, or my cynicism or some other inherent failure of mine, but U think the whole hypercube thing was a failure?|@mackb, June 27 via Twitter|
@jestdempsey Or a partial success with some fails on the choices made by too few people with too little time and not enough background?|@mackb, June 27 via Twitter|
@euthanaut same here! pretty pissed about it, not a sore looser just think a lot of us were using creativity & others spent $ & kissed ass|@RinnaMP, June 24 via Twitter|
I didn’t win a cube, not surprised. it was a popularity contest. Had a feeling most of the Qc winners would be from Mtl, was right *pouting*|@RinnaMP, June 24 via Twitter|
@thehypercube for some who have crap luck in life I think it’s natural to be angry & sad, No mud slinging here but still feel let down..|@RinnaMP, June 27 via Twitter|
@thehypercube any word yet about the participating prize for the “cubeless” lol|@RinnaMP, June 30 via Twitter|
Is it sad that I will not miss all the people who so quickly turned their backs on me when the chance arose? I don’t think it is.|@heartsandclefs, June 26 via Twitter|
Congrats to all the winners!!! Thank god this fucking think is over!!! Can I go home now?|@SunnyCrittenden, June 23 via Twitter|

@scarletwords Me too. :o( I cried all the way home, haven’t slept yet, still crying. I just don’t know where to go from here. I had plans.|@SunnyCrittenden, June 24 via Twitter|
@sendmorecops I literally started menstruating 5 minutes after I found out I didn’t win the Cube.|@SunnyCrittenden, June 24 via Twitter|
Hey, so in case everyone missed my early morning tweet, I started a new blog: www.cubeless.ca #hypercube #thehypercube #nissancube|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
Some people, who have short attention spans or “don’t read good” think I’m just being a sore loser but if u read, that’s not what it’s about|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
@mackb1991 Yep, bait & switch definitely. You should post that on the blog. It’s one thing to get support from my peeps, it’s better to get|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
@mackb1991 it from contest peeps. (No pressure, though.)|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
Tweeple, have any of you heard about supposed bug in Twitter where suddenly people drop off your follow list and vice versa?|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
Okay so far the only people apparently having this “Twitter problem” where ppl are being unfollowed are from the Hypercube contest. Curious.|@SunnyCrittenden, June 26 via Twitter|
Good morning my tweeples. *rubs the crust from her eyes* Have you been to www.cubeless.ca yet? Things are heating up in there.|@SunnyCrittenden, June 27 via Twitter|
