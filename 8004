TagWorld
[[Image:Tagworld.jpg|thumb|right|TagWorld: it's like MySpace, but with one important difference: the user picture is on the right.]] '''TagWorld''' is a [[Stalker|social networking]] site, similar to [[MySpace]], but focusing more on [[music]].  Although it boasts over 2 million users, the actual number of users is significantly smaller for one reason: it is completely [[homosexual]]. When TagWorld started, [[everyone]] created an account because they thought it would be better than MySpace.  When they realized it was just as lame, everyone stopped using it - the same would happen with [[LiveVideo]].
