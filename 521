== Introduction ==

Established in May 2006 by boy genius <b>Alphabet</b>, AnonIB became one of the leading  "new [[b/|/b/]]'s" following the original /b/'s downfall on [[b/-day|August 23, 2006]]. It quickly rose to become one of the [[Internet|interweb's]] leading image dumps, specializing in [[furry]], [[yiff]], [[CP]] and wall to wall [[fail]]. Despite its questionable content and [[retard|mentally handicapped]] userbase, the site ran smoothly for nearly two years, until <b>The Supreme Fucktard Mindpoop</b> took over administration and decided to [[rape|buttfuck]] its userbase for the [[lulz]].

On April 1st 2008, AnonIB was [[rape|blackbagged]] by the [[FBI|party van]], largely due to Mindshit's unbelievable [[faggotry]]. The original site vanished into the ether, resulting in the tragic loss of [[over 9,000]] child pr0n boards. Millions of [[pedophiles]] were left homeless in ensuing chaos, which is now known to be linked to the economic recession currently gripping the world. <b>The New Improved AnonIB</b> finally returned around July 2008, with perverts and furfags scrambling to recreate their pedo-boards before [[The man]] could [[rape|assrape]] them again. 

Fully updated with [[Last_Measure|computer-destroying pop-ups]] and [[chris-chan|batshit crazy]] [[Faggot|moderators]], AnonIB now functions as the final cesspool for all of the [[shit]] generated by 4chan and its rivals. Every gross, disgusting, tired old meme to ever grace the tubes eventually finds its way to AnonIB (along with the [[masturbation|masturbating]] [[Fucktard|fucktards]] who originally posted them). Individual boards cater to a wide range of interests relating to [[pedophile|naked children]] and [[bestiality|barnyard animals]]. By far the most popular board is Mindshits's very own <b>Teens No Rules</b> (TNR) which manages to combine the two areas in ways never before imagined, even in [[Your mum]]'s sickest fantasies.

== Historical overview ==
[[Image:Anonib.jpg|thumb|400px|<b>AnonIB</b>: hands down the [[shit|SHITTIEST]] [[chan]] on the entire fucking [[internet|interwebs]].]]

Some time ago in the dim, dark recesses of [[last thursday]], a promising young genius named Alphabet envisioned a scheme under which every single [[furry|furfag]] in the universe could create his very own [[4Chan]] with a minimum of trouble. Unaware of the horror he was about to unleash on the unsuspecting world, Alphabet named his new site AnonIB; <b>Anon</b>ymous <b>I</b>mage <b>B</b>oard. The new system was viewed as a godsend by [[Furry|furries]] and [[pedophile|pedofags]] (mostly because they couldn't post their [[Child porn|sick-ass shit]] anywhere else), and was an immediate success with [[basement dweller]]s across the globe. Before long, AnonIBs were erupting forth like cum over a [[camwhore]]'s face, and every pathetic loser in the [[United States|States]] had an imageboard to call his own - even the dimmest [[moron]]s too [[retard|fucking stupid]] to learn basic php. 

AnonIB flourished well under Alphabet's administration; so well, in fact, that the bandwidth soon outstripped AB's limited resources, leading to intermittent downtime and major [[Bawwwww|BAAAAWWWING]] from the furries (not that anyone cared about <i>them,</i> of course). Alphabet himself was reduced to begging donations on several occasions, but AnonIB's userbase proved amazingly loyal, sometimes contributing as much as <i>five dollars</i> to help keep the site running. The show limped along like this for almost two years, and though money was always tighter than a [[Republican]]'s asshole, the [[child porn|kiddie pr0n]] continued growing at an exponential rate and everybody was happy.

(Except maybe [[Party van|The Partyvan]], but we'll get into that later.)

The real problems began when Alphabet handed AnonIB over to [[sick fuck|online pornographer]] <b>Mindpoop</b>. A pathological [[Lie|liar]] in every sense of the word, Mindshit has often claimed to have bought the site from Alphabet for several hundred thousand dollars, but this is complete [[bullshit]], like everything else he says. [[Internet detective]]s have conclusively proven that Alphabet <i>gave</i> the site to this Jew because he simply couldn't afford to run it any more. [[Some argue]] nothing, because this is the truth, and Mindshit has since proven himself to be the [[cunt|biggest cunt]] on the [[Internet|interwebs]].

Working in collaboration with his [[faggot|ghey fuckbuddy]] <b>GOA</b>, Mindshit immediately set about [[raping]] the site with banners ads, pop ups, pop overs, pop unders, interstitials and every other kind of [[shit]] imaginable. User complaints were either ignored or met with open contempt; in some cases, posters were told to bend over the table and spread their cheeks for penetrative [[buttsecks]]. Anyone who objected to the changes was [[Flame|flamed]] into submission by Mindshit's hired [[troll]]s, and all mention of Alphabet's "Golden Age" was forbidden on pain of immense [[butthurt]].

==The Party Van==

[[Image:FBIRIP.jpg|thumb|right|Partyvan strikes again and another imageboard site bites the dust.]]

By the end of March 2008, Mindshit's [[faggotry]] had reached levels that even the [[FBI]] couldn't ignore, and [[FBI|the Partyvan]] turned its attention to AnonIB's writhing cesspool of [[Pedophile|pedo-flavored]] [[crap]]. Absolutely no warning was given: the first sign of the approaching [[lollercaust]] came when the entire site vanished without a trace in April 2008. Chaos spread through the intertubes like a torrent of liquid [[shit]]: [[furfags|yiffers]] and pedofags alike were left [[masturbation|jerking off]] to empty computer screens, while millions of dimwitted [[basement-dweller]]s were forced to return to [[12chan]] in search of tender young [[loli]] flesh. It was the biggest online [[Bawwwww|Bawwwwfest]] since the [[The Caturday Nap|Borg invasion of 2007]], only with [[Epic fail|infinitely more fail]] for everyone concerned.

As usual, the blame could only be placed on the site's new administration. Spending most of his free time fucking Krazyfag [[in the ass]], Mindshit somehow failed to notice the vast amounts of [[Child pornography|kiddie porn]] being exchanged hand-over-dick on <b>Teens No Rules</b> and other [[Child pornography|child-friendly boards]]. In retrospect, the result was as predictable as it was unavoidable: [[The man|The Man]] confiscated the [[Delete fucking everything|entire fucking intertubes]] and AnonIB disappeared faster than a [[cam whore|camslut's]] hymen on her twelth birthday.

Eventually the [[butthurt]] cleared long enough for someone to ask [[WTF]] was going on. Needless to say, answers were not immediately forthcoming: Mindshit was too busy trying to evade the complimentary [[buttsecks|cavity search]] at Partyvan Central. Knowing that thousands of angry /b/tards were now howling for his blood ("WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BOARD YOU FUCKING SHITBAG??!!!"), Mindshit did what he always does best: he [[Lie|lied through his fucking teeth]] to shift the blame onto someone else. And as usual, the userbase swallowed it with as much relish as [[Sarah Palin]] gorging on [[John McCain]]'s diseased, yellow [[cum|pecker-snot]].

== Global Moderators ==

[[Image:KRAZYFAG.gif|thumb|Business as usual: <b>Mindshit</b> and <b>Krazyfag</b> discuss policy at AnonIB.]]

Once the site was back online, Mindshit proceeded to mobilize his own [[X is not your personal army|personal army]] to patrol the network. Composed entirely of Mindshit's [[gay|ghey fuckbuddies]], the <b>Global Moderators</b> are a band of inbred neo-[[Nazi]] [[faggot]]s whose sole purpose is to [[ban]] anyone they don't like. Potential drama hovers around defcon 4: hardly a day goes by without one of these bleeding [[cunt]]s pitching a childish BAAAAWWWfest over some trivial user complaint. 

Popular [[Lie|popular]] mods include [[faggot|Fromstf]] and [[pedophile|JD]], whose job it is to hunt down and delete any board lacking [[homosexual]] content. The remainder of the staff are a coalition of world-class [[asshole]]s who spend most of their time [[Ruin|ruining the internets]] and jacking off to pictures of [[Bill O'Reilly]]. They can usually be found hanging out on the [http://www.anonib.com/newsuggestions/ New Suggestions Board] when they aren't out playing [[Internet Tough Guy]] or [[Rape|encouraging]] little boys to suck their [[Penis|lollipops]]. 

This is where the majority of AnonIB drama actually takes place, largely due to everyone knowing that the mods are a bunch of [[sick fuck]] [[pedophile|pedo-fags]]. Basically, anyone who objects to the vast number of CP boards gets [[rape|raped]] [[in the ass|up the ass]] and banned until the end of time; the only ones who escape [[buttsecks|summary judgment]] are those willing to kiss <b>Krazypro's</b> puckery [[asshole]] [[at least 99]] times.

Please note that while the New Suggestions Board says "post your complaints/issues/suggestions here", ordinary users are <u>forbidden</u> to voice their grievances on [[Death|pain of death]]. Mindpoop actually set up the board to give the Global Mods somewhere to whine like the [[butthurt]] little [[bitch]]es they truly are. Consequently, the ''slightest hint'' of criticism will get your [[ass]] b& for the next sixty years, [[The Internet is serious business|so just watch your fucking step, faggot]]!!!

==The Pop-under virus saga==

[[Image:CAUTION02.jpg|thumb|300px|AnonIB malware warning: Posting this to the [http://www.anonib.com/newsuggestions/ New Suggestions Board] will win you an instant [[banhammer]].]]

Amongst the many [[shit|crapshit]] changes introduced by the new administration were literally <i>thousands</i> of pop-unders, each one capable of evading even the most sophisticated ad-blocker. In spite of the admin's [[Bullshit|official explanation]], these pop-unders were <i>not</i> added to increase the site's revenue, but rather out of [[Ruination|a malicious desire to seriously fuck up your computer]]. This was accomplished through the use of drive-by downloads and numerous viruses (including the dreaded MicrosoftEXE), leading to the destruction of [[over 9,000]] hardrives and the economic collapse of [[Iceland]].

Eventually, some [[an hero|brave soul]] ventured to point out that it did ''not'' make good business sense to [[fuck]] with your userbase and drive them away by the millions; unfortunately, he was immediately [[rape|assraped]] with the [[banhammer]] and forced to suck [[Faggot|Krazypro's]] [[cock]] for six months. Despite intensive [[buttsecks|buttfucking]] by the Global mods, the complaints continued to mount up as countless users had their systems infected. The Admin immediately [[masturbation|reacted]] to the problem by adding more pop-unders and instructing the Global Mods to [[death|kill]] anyone who complained. [[Geek|Fromstf]] and several [[nerds]] from the TechHelp board suggested using [[Firefox]] plug-ins such as greasemonkey, but most people thought he was discussing his sexual fantasies again. A few users actually [[butthurt|appealed]] directly to Mindshit himself; however, he was too busy [[fuck|buttfucking]] Krazyfag to bother answering his emails. And so things stood for [[At least 100 years ago|at least one hundred years]], with users BAAAWWWING that the pop-unders were destroying their computers and the Globals screaming "STFU you [[faggots]], we don't fucking care!!!"

'''A typical example from the New Suggestions board:'''

'''ANONYMOUS:'''

I think my computer got a virus from one of the pop-unders. The admin really needs to do something about this.

'''GLOBAL MOD:''' 

SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU STINKING LITTLE [[Drama whore|DRAMA-FAGGOT]]!!! THE ADMIN DOESN'T HAVE TO DO SQUAT!!! IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE POP-UNDERS, [[GTFO|GET THE FUCK OUT]] AND START YOUR OWN DAMNED BOARD, YOU WORTHLESS, DOG-FUCKING INGRATE!!! 

'''ANONYMOUS:'''

Jeez, things were never like this under Alphabet.

'''GLOBAL MOD:'''

ALPHABET DOESN'T OWN THIS BOARD ANYMORE, YOU [[Cocksmoker|COCKSMOKING]] SACK OF PIGSHIT!!! THIS SITE COSTS [[Over 9000|OVER $9000]] TO MAINTAIN, AND THE POP-UNDERS PAY THE BILLS!!! IF YOU CAN'T PUT UP WITH A COUPLE OF VIRUSES DESTROYING YOUR HARDRIVE EVERY TIME YOU LAND ON THE SITE, THEN THAT'S JUST <u>TOUGH</u> <u>SHIT</u>, ISN'T IT??!!! NOW CRAWL BACK TO YOUR BASEMENT AND FUCK YOUR [[Fat|FAT]] [[Whore|WHORE]] OF A MOTHER [[In the ass|UP THE ASS AGAIN]]!!!

'''ANONYMOUS:'''
Surely you don't want malware on the site. 

'''GLOBAL MOD:'''

OK, THAT'S IT!!! I'M SICK AND TIRED OF YOU WHINING [[Faggot|FAGGOTS]] BAAAWWWWING ABOUT HOW BAD THINGS ARE AROUND HERE!!! <u>BANNED FOR LIFE</u>, YOU PIECE OF SHIT [[Fucktard|FUCKTARD]]!!! KEEP THE FUCK OFF OUR SITE!!! IF WE CATCH YOU HERE AGAIN WE'LL RAEP YOU [[In the ass|UP THE ASS]] WITH A RUSTY CHAINSAW!!!<br />

The malware continued [[rape|raping]] AnonIB like [[Hitler]] in [[Poland]] until Mindpoop took a break from his cocksucking and noticed the drop in revenue as users abandoned the crap-infested site by the droves. Instantly [[shit|shitting]] his pants, MP realized that [[fuck|fucking over]] his user-base ''wasn't'', in fact, good for business, and set about [[Masturbation|rectifying the oversite]]. This consisted mainly of posting <u>one</u> message admitting there ''may'' be a problem; claiming that the administration has [[Lie|no control]] over which pop-unders contain malware; and to report it to your [[Hate|friendly]] [[Retard|Global Mods]] if an infection occurs. Mindshit presumably returned to his beloved [[buttsecks]] soon afterwords, as no one has heard from him since. 

As of this writing, AnonIB is still flooded with viruses, pop-ups and assorted [[faggotry]]. Practically nothing has changed, except that the entire site has been blacklisted by [[Internet Explorer]], leading to a [[Fail|MASSIVE downturn in web traffic]]. AnonIB is now [[lulz|teetering on the brink of bankruptcy]] due its computer-destroying viruses, and the admin stubbornly refuses to purge the malware from its network. In addition, board creation was disabled for two months, multiple boards have been fragged, <i>thousands</i> of potential users locked out by the malware - and the Globals STILL claim there's [[Bullshit|nothing wrong with the fucking site]].

What a bunch of [[faggot]]s.

==Memorable Quotes==
[[Image:KRAZYFAG02.jpg|thumb|300px|AnonIB's highly trained staff handle user requests.]] 
Posting a legitimate complaint on [http://www.anonib.com/newsuggestions/ New Suggestions] will result in prompt action from AnonIB's extremely [[troll|mature]] and [[masturbation|highly trained]] moderation staff:

{{quote|You expect us to act professionally? this is a free image board, not a fortune 500 company. You don't pay us and we don't get paid so piss off.}}

{{quote|Fuck I hate these idiots why doesn't anyone read board rules.}}

{{quote|We are not your friend, we are not your family. We are the mods we enforce the rules and deal with your bullshit. we can say what ever we want and troll you all we want.}}

{{quote|We have to put up with your bullshit, being <s>snippy</s> a cunt comes with the job.}}

{{quote|You have no idea how this site works, do you? Learn the hierarchy of AnonIB because I highly doubt God of Anon, Mindpoop, or the Global Moderators give a shit.}}

{{quote|Go fuck yourself.}}

{{quote|There are no rights expressed or implied on anonib. You are subject to the whims of others. Nothing irks me more than people claiming to have rights on websites they do not own.| <b>Adminyous</b> and various global [[fucktards]] responding to user requests on the New Suggestions Board.}}

In recent weeks, the problems have accellerated as AnonIB inches steadily towards the brink of bankruptcy. Malware, trolling and piracy have become the norm; threads vanish, codewords are phished and - as always - [[asshole]]s reign supreme on Anonymous ImageBoard. Not that <i>any</i> of that will matter once the admin finishes circumcising the site: with board creation disabled and traffic down the single digits, there won't be anything <i>left</i> to hijack by the end of the year. WTG, Mindshit.

== The Peon Revolution of 2009 ==
[[Image:Attacksite.jpg|thumb|300px|AnonIB's homepage as it appears to the average user.]] 
By the beginning of January 2009, AnonIB's [[retard|mentally deficient]] user-base was on the verge of [[nerd rage|outright rebellion]]. Mindshit and his [[faggot|ghey]] [[bureaucratic fuck|fuckbuddies]] had [[rape|assraped]] the site for close on twelve months and literally everyone was sick of the constant [[shit|shit]] flooding the system. Trolls had overrun New Suggestions, SFW boards were inundated  with [[child pornography|child pr0n]] and servers were crashing faster than a [[masturbation|/b/tard cums over his monitor]]. Requests for technical support were met with the familiar refrain of "fuck you" from the Globals, while <b>GodOfAnon</b> made it his business to personally [[banhammer|buttfuck]] anyone who dared criticize the admin's handling of the situation. In short, AnonIB was descending into a whirling cesspool of [[fail]] - and the <i>best</i> part was that absolutely [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody gave a shit]].

By February 2009, daily traffic took a sharp [[Denial of Service|nosedive]] as the malware reached critical mass. AnonIB was blacklisted by both [[Google]] and [[IE]] due to trojans, pop-ups and related shit, the final result being that users began deserting the site by the hundreds. The entire network became a ghostown overnight; the only boards seeing the slightest [[profit]] were those of the "[[pedophile|child friendly]]" variety. As usual, the admin denied any wrongdoing during this treadmill of faggotry, blatantly denying that any problem even existed. Within days, a full-blown [[flame war]] broke out on New Suggestions as users demanded improvements and the Globals defended their god-given right to flush AnonIB down the shit-tube.  

The standoff came to a head when <b>Mindshit</b> himself weighed in on the argument, stating that the site probably <i>would</i> do better without all the [[AIDS]]-infested popups. This seemed to pacify the peons to some degree: n00bs and oldfags alike rejoiced across the entire web, celebrating AnonIB's impending liberation from the malware tyranny. And so matters stood until word got 'round that Mindpoop [[Wat|no longer actually owned the site]] - and that subsequently, nothing the [[lie|lying fuck]] said was worth [[lie|jack shit]] at the best of times. 

Unknown to everyone, GodofAnon had been in control of [[Epic Fail|The World's Shittiest Chan]] since December 2008. Like his predecessor, GOA proved to be an arrogant cunt-wad more concerned with [[blow|sticking blow up his nose]] than running an imageboard. His first act was to crush the Peon Revolution by [[delete fucking everything|erasing everything]] on the New Suggestions board and posting a general sticky telling the userbase to go [[fuck]] itself: <b>"There will <u>ALWAYS</u> be advertisements on AnonIB, you worthless [[Faggot|FAGGOTS]]. This ISN'T a democracy and you DON'T have any say in how this site is run. If you don't like the pop-ups, then that's [[Internet tough guy|TOUGH SHIT]], isn't it? Download greasemonkey or piss off somewhere else, you whining [[asshole]]s!!1!!"</b> 

AnonIB went offline the following week.

==Staff tolerance of child pornography==

[[Faggot|A certain troll]] who <s>terrorized</s> got buttfucked by [[renchan|Renchan]]/Flatchan (another den of pedophiles) was banned from <b>Teens No Rules</b> for <s>trolling one thread about a pissed off ex-boyfriend who releases pictures of this skater chick he was fucking, then gets posters remorse and begs to have them taken down</s> acting like a [[faggot]].

Massive butthurt naturally ensued, and the [[faggot|troll]] - <b>Party_shaker</b> by name - confronted Judge Dredd in some gay chatroom. Claiming to have a board exploit, Partyfag demanded to have the ban rescinded, "or he'll squeel (sic) about it in [[pp4l|IRC]]." JD replied with "Meh, whatever" and the two proceeded to [[masturbation|discuss the joys of child porn]]:

<b>NB:</b> This [[shit|poorly written section]] was posted by [[User:party_shaker|party_shaker]], a self-promoting [[faggot]] who will [[virgin|never have sex]] with a real [[woman]]. Party_shaker is indisputably one of the biggest [[gay|homos]] on the web and suffered a severe case of [[nerd rage]] after reading this paragraph.

==How to [[Troll]] AnonIB==

Trolling AnonIB's Global Moderators is almost ridiculously simple. Just go to the [http://www.anonib.com/newsuggestions/ New Suggestions Board] and do any of the following:

*Claim that you are an underage girl whose nude photos have been plastered all over one of AnonIB's numerous child pr0n boards. Be very careful not to mention ''which'' board or provide any otherwise 'useful' information.

*Post a message demanding that all of the 3D [[lolicon]] boards be shut down on the grounds that they're [[child porn]]. Then sit back and enjoy the shitfest while the [[pedophile|pedo-fags]] start screaming that 3D loli is [[Lie|not illegal]] and that [[masturbation|jacking off]] to CG pics of [[loli|little girls]] being [[fuck|fucked]] [[in the ass|up the ass]] is the Constitutional Right of <u>every</u> red-blooded American pervert!!1!

*Pretend to be Chris L. Hanssen and write a long, childish message complaining that someone is harassing you. Utter chaos will ensue for at least six hours, because [[Anonymous|everyone]] absolutely <u>hates</u> this [[faggot|guy]] (Note: this particular Chris Hanssen is NOT [[Chris Hansen|the man with the seat]]).

*Post a [[batshit]] [[crazy]] message threatening legal action if Teens No Rules isn't shut down by [[last Thursday]]. Follow up with some samefag replies supporting the idea.

*Tell Krazypyro he's an illiterate [[cunt]].

*Announce to the world that the Global Mods are a bunch of lazy, incompetent [[faggots]], then apply for KrazyPyro's job on the grounds that at least you can read English.

*Complain that the NSFW sites don't load in IE. This will get you banned until the next Ice Age for some reason.

*Post a picture of [[Patrick Stewart]] (who is bald) onto any board you come across, then report it to the Global Mods as CP (<u>C</u>aptain <u>P</u>ickard, gettit?).

*BAAAAWWWWW that you were unfairly banned from <s>some</s> any board. This will generate a lulzfest of titanic proportions.

*Pretend to be some [[shit|crapshit]] [[DA]] fan artist whose work has been posted to AnonIB without permission. For extra lulz, say that your copyright notice has been deliberately removed, and that you'll be taking [[legal action]] if the pics aren't taken down immediately (NB: be sure to mention that your uncle is a big city [[E-lawyer|lawyer]], this is practically mandatory on AnonIB).

*Report a site bug or have a general question, results in a ban from a neckbeard moderator.

==Timeline==
[[Image:AnonIBOWNED.jpg|thumb|300px|[[For great justice]]: AnonIB [[rape|totally assfucked]] by [[Ebaums]] and [[420chan]].]] 

*May, 2006: AnonIB founded by Alphabet in the corner of his dorm room. Site is immediately overwhelmed with [[pedophile|pedos]] and [[Furry|furfags]], resulting in intermittent downtime and assorted faggotry.

*March, 2008: no longer capable of sustaining bandwidth costs, Alphabet hands AnonIB over to online [[Child porn|pornographers]] <b>Mindshit</b> and <b>GOA</b>, who immediately assrape the network with popups and malware.

*April 2008: Mindshit makes the [[Epic fail|stupendous error]] of changing servers. The new host demands $20,000 a month for <s>bandwidth bills</s> to keep quiet about the child porn. Negotiations fall through and the hard drives are handed over to the [[FBI|Feds]]. 

*May 1st, 2008: The <b>New Improved AnonIB</b> returns without backups. Mindshit stated that they got [[v&]] and the FBI has their hard drives. Furries, pedofags and everyone else runs for cover, fearing this will spell certain [[doom]] for all those who downloaded CP from the site (ie, everybody).

*May 1st, 2009: Almost one year to the day since the <b>New Improved AnonIB</b> returned under Mindshit, the entire network goes [[Delete fucking everything|offline once more]]. A veritable shitstorm erupts across the interweb as [[furry|furries]] and [[pedophile|pedofags]] alike [[Baw|bemoan the loss]] of their [[sick fuck]] [[porn|porno]] boards. Rumors instantly begin circlating that the Van has blackbagged AnonIB for the second time. <b>GodOfAnon</b> eventually [[lie|claims]] that they're simply [[ruin|changing servers]] to <s>improve quality of service</s> [[ruin]] the site beyond all hope of repair.

*May 5th 2009: [[faggot|Mindshit]] has [[Delete fucking everything|completely killed the site]], redirecting all AnonIB addresses to mindpoop.com and stated that there will be "no more user created boards" and that "Teens No Rules will not be remade". <s>This means that, effective as of May 5th 2009, anonIB as it was known is dead and gone.</s> DISREGARD THAT!!! THEY'RE BACK (TEMPORARILY)!!!

*May 6th 2009: Mindshit has deleted the post saying that board creation would be disabled and that he'd only be adding boards <i>he</i> wanted to. Apparently, he's not a <i>complete</i> idiot. To placate infuriated users, he's also [[Bullshit|promising that all current anonIB boards would be transferred to mindpoop.com and that the servers would be fast as lightning after the changeover]]. This is, of course, [[Lie|complete and total horseshit]].

*May 8th 2009: According to information posted at <b>Websiteoutlook.com,</b> AnonIB's daily traffic has been [[fail|falling steadily]] since December 2008, took a sharp nosedive around February 2009, and is now at an all-time low with the site completely offline. Appears that that <b>GodofAnon</b> and [[AnonIB#Global_Moderators|The Butthurt Squad]] are determined to drive the entire site into the sewer by the end of the year. Well, that's only to be anticipated: what else can one expect from an admin composed <i>entirely</i> of [[troll]]s and [[faggots]]?

*May 14th 2009: More AnonIB [[faggot|faggotry]]: the transfer is finally complete, the boards are back up - and site is <u>STILL</u> complete and utter SHIT. Despite GOA's [[bullshit|assurances of a MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT under the new servers]], absolutely <i>nothing</i> has changed. In fact, things seem even <i>worse</i> than before: boards are twice as slow, images aren't uploading and the whole fucking site has been vanishing for hours at a time! Fighting a losing battle here, guise. This <i>has</i> to be one of the most spectacular examples of [[fail|EPIC FAIL]] ever seen on the intertubez.<br>

*May 25th 2009: <b>GodOfAnon</b> is desperately trying to lure customers back with [[bullshit| promises of improved service]], but it’s a classic case of “[[ruin|too little, too late]].” Users have had enough of of AnonIB’s <U>[[AnonIB#Global_Moderators|incessant shit]]</U> and are voting with their feet. Way to go, GOA: AnonIB used to be an utterly awesome site, but you and your [[AnonIB#Global_Moderators|ghey fuckbuddies]] have turned it into a [[fail|writhing mass of fail]]. We give you <s>eight</s> <s>six</s> <s>two</s> months before the whole fucking site goes offline. [[Shit nobody cares about|Nothing of value will be lost]], but at least [[for great justice|great justice]] will be served.

*16 August, 2009: Unnamed [[faggot|scriptkiddies]] mounted a successful raid against <b>AnonIB;</b> hacked in via an exploit and [[Delete fucking everything|deleted fucking everything]]!! Literally [[Over 9000|thousands]] of boards were fragged in a matter of hours leaving millions of [[furry|furries]] and [[pedophile|pedofags]] homeless in the ensuing chaos. The hackers originally claimed they were from [[420chan]], but the most likely suspect is [[Ebaums]]. GOA immediately reacted to the encroaching [[lulz|lollercaust]] by [[Hookers and blow|sticking blow up his nose]] for the next 48 hours. In the meantime, hundreds of desperate [[furry|furfags]] tried to set up new boards, but the hackers continued [[rape|raeping]] the site into oblivion. The final result of this online clusterfuck was [[fail]] of almost indescribable proportions. To quote the invaders: <b>"Although everything was deleted, nothing of value was lost."</b> 

*10 Decemeber, 2009: After BAWWWWWING an ocean Of tears it appears the moralfags have won. Global admins have stated that any more questionable content will result in the server being fragged. Sounds like someone is going to need new hosting AMIRITE?

* 11 March, 2010: Site is "down for maintenance". 

* 13 March, 2010: AnonIB.com brings up a 404 error.

* 16 March, 2010: All [[crap|boards]] can be viewed but attempting to reply to any thread results in a [[fail|403]] forbidden error.

* 21 March, 2010:  Looks like the place is fucked.
* 25 March, 2010:  The [[faggotry]] continues as AnonIB is up again with the [[Over_9000|majority]] of the pages being [[In_the_ass|buttfucked]] by linkbucks ads.
* 27 March, 2010: Attempts to access the site resault in a failed connection, much BAWWWINGG by [[pedofags]] and [[furrys]] ensure.
* 27 March (evening), 2010: Above's attempts to access site are fail. It seems to be up. Also, people who complain about linkbucks obviously don't know how to use [http://www.greasespot.net/ greasemonkey] and the [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/32028 Linkbucks Skipper] Script.
* 6 April 2010: The entire [[lie|SFW Females]] section disappears, take the very popular [[12chan|nonnudepics]] board with it. Recently exiled 12channers [[lose]] their [[baw|minds.]]
* 8 November 10, The site is down yet again, this time, kicked off yet another host because of [[CP]] complaints.
