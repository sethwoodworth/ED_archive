'''Scott Thomas Beauchamp''' is a [[fucktard]] [[Army|American soldier]] currently serving in [[Iraq]] and a contributor for ''The New Republic'', a [[shit|respected]] [[liberalism|left of center]] magazine no one reads. His most recent article, "Shock Troops", has touched off a shitstorm that has created feelings of impotent rage and [[butthurt]] on both sides of the Blawg-sphere. He is considered a Real Americ[[an Hero]]! or a traitor worse than Benedict Arnold and [[John Kerry]] put together, depending on who you ask. [[Some argue]] that the internet bitch-fest surrounding Beauchamp's essay may be the deciding battle in the War on [[terrorism|Terror]].

== Background Info ==
Until recently Beauchamp led an uneventful boring life and maintained a [[gay]] [[emo]] [[blog]][http://ghostsonfilm.blogspot.com/]. After joining the [[Army]], Beauchamp approached ''The New Republic'' editor, Franklin Foer, and offered to write essays based on his experiences while deployed in [[Iraq]]. Foer agreed to hire Beauchamp on the condition that he man[[whore]] himself out to ''TNR'' reporter and [http://pajamasmedia.com/2007/08/how_the_new_republic_got_sucke.php one of three FACT-CHECKERS employed by the magazine], Elspeth Reeve, which he did. 

After joining the [[Army]], Beauchamp started another, much better blawg [http://scottthomas.us here]. This blawg is 100% true and has been corroborated with anonymous military personnel.

== "Shock Troops", an Essay Which Will Live in Infamy ==
[[Image:Acidvictims.jpg|thumb|Mmmmmmmmm, SEXY!!!!11111]]
On July 13, 2007, ''The New Republic'' published [http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070723&s=diarist072307 "Shock Troops"], the most horrific first-person account of the Iraq War, nay, ''any war'' written to date. The essay describes three incidents of evil, barbaric [[lulz|atrocities]] committed by American soldiers which resulted in no less than 0 deaths and 0 civilian casualties.

In the first incident, Private Beauchamp demonstrates that he has a way with the ladies by loudly expressing his lust for a woman with some skin problems.

'''''The thing that stood out about her, though, wasn't her strange uniform but the fact that nearly half her face was severely scarred. Or, rather, it had more or less melted, along with all the hair on that side of her head.'''''

Go for it, Scott!

'''''"Yeah man," I continued. "I love chicks that have been intimate--with IEDs. It really turns me on--melted skin, missing limbs, plastic noses ... ." '''''
'''''"You're crazy, man!" my friend said, doubling over with laughter. I took it as my cue to continue.'''''
'''''"In fact, I was thinking of getting some girls together and doing a photo shoot. Maybe for a calendar? IED Babes.' We could have them pose in thongs and bikinis on top of the hoods of their blown-up vehicles."'''''

In the second incident Beauchamp's platoon finds a [[Saddam_Hussein|Saddam]] era mass grave filled with the bones of children. An unnamed evil Jew soldier makes a yarmulke out of a [[muslim]] child's remains. [[Lulz]] ensue.

'''''One private, infamous as a joker and troublemaker, found the top part of a human skull, which was almost perfectly preserved. It even had chunks of hair, which were stiff and matted down with dirt. He squealed as he placed it on his head like a crown. It was a perfect fit. As he marched around with the skull on his head, people dropped shovels and sandbags, folding in half with laughter. No one thought to tell him to stop. No one was disgusted. Me included.'''''

The third incident involves an unnamed Bradley tank driver playing a [[funny|hilarious]] joke on local dogs.

'''''A dog that was lying in the street and bathing in the sun didn't have enough time to get up and run away from the speeding Bradley. Its front half was completely severed from its rear, which was twitching wildly, and its head was still raised and smiling at the sun as if nothing had happened at all.'''''

== Reaction to "Shock Troops"==
The article was initially praised for giving a harrowing account of the grim realities of [[war]] by people who have never been to [[Iraq]] and know nothing about the grim realities of war.

The veracity of Beauchamp's claims were questioned by Micheal Goldfarb, the editor ''The Weekly Standard'', a [[shit|respected]] [[conservative|right of center]] magazine that no one reads. The collective voices of the rightard blawg-sphere were troubled by the publication of "Shock Troops" and were all like [[ZOMG]]!! THA [[terror|TERRORISTS]] ARE WINNING!!!!111111 An army of conservative blawggers, including the likes of [[Michelle Malkin]] and Ace of Spades, were hell bent on discrediting Beauchamp and his essay. 

== Reaction to the Reaction ==
[[Leftard]] blawggers were all [[butthurt]] that those [[coward|chickenhawks]] in the rightard blawg-sphere dared to question the honor of Private Beauchamp. It didn't matter that many of the critics were themselves [[military]] veterans. Anyone who criticizes a soldier criticizing the war is a chickenhawk.

== The New Republic Vindicated ==
[[Image:Franklinfoer.jpg|thumb|Respected journalist Franklin Foer, "My butt hurts." :,(]]
The editors of ''TNR'' released a statement saying they stood by Beauchamp's article and that anonymous military personnel had corroborated everything in the article, save one detail. The incident with Beauchamp and the female burn victim took place in Kuwait, not [[Iraq]].

No one was more [[butthurt]] by the allegations against Beauchamp than TNR editor Franklin Foer who had this to say...

'''''â€œMy magazine this last week has been subject of basically a smear job by the Weekly Standard and a lot of the conservative blogosphere over a piece that we published from a soldier in Iraq, which we have gone back and re-reported and it turned out to be aside from one mistake to be the case and I just wish that there was, and this sounds like a trite mainstream media criticism, but that those in the blogosphere who kind of move from one reckless allegation to another reckless allegation for once apologize when they get something wrong."'''''[http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/blog/g/49503cf3-e367-4a8c-9fb0-6c1557959154]

== The New Republic Pwned, sort of ==
[[Image:Tnr_box_set.jpg|thumb]]
[[Matt Sanchez]], a [[faggot]] ex-porn star/man[[whore]], and the rightard blawg-sphere's agent in FOB Falcon, Private Beauchamp's base in [[Iraq]], announced on his [http://www.matt-sanchez.com/2007/08/beachamp-invest.html blawg] that the Army had completed an investigation into Beauchamp's allegations and found them to be false. The ''TNR'' editors responded by crying softly and cutting themselves. But they have yet to retract "Shock Troops". Now, the blawggers of the rightard 'sphere are going nuts, because this is the closest they actually get to [[pwn]]ing someone.
