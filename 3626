Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus
[[Image:Hardvice1.jpg|thumb|right|HO, HO, HARLEQUIN ICHTHYOSIS FETUS!]]  [[image:Harlequin2Rodeo.jpg|thumb|Little known fact:Harlequin fetus' also like rodeos]]Harlequin Icthyosis, also known as "Snake Babies" or "Holy Shit I'm Getting An Abortion In Case I Give Birth To One Of Those Monsters!" is a skin disease characterized by making babies look like [[Shit bands|Marilyn Manson]] and die young -- so young they are still on [[The Virginmobile]].

The details of the disease aren't really [[relevant]], because the Harlequin Fetus is one of the Internet's most famous [[memes]].  It is a [[fact]] that every obstetrician starts to drool as soon as one of these monsters is dropped, because they are fucking [[delicious cake|delicious]], especially deep fried.  The crispy skin is especially prized by [[Mexicans]] because of their fondness for roast pig.

Harlequin babies have been considered one of the most [[lulz|lulz-inducing]] [[IRL]] pwns since [[Win|landmines]] because the parents only find out after the baby is born. The existance of Harlequin babies has been used to support the theory that [[God]] loves practical jokes. 

Have some more fun by relating it to dead baby jokes. There's nothing funnier than [[dead babies]].

=="SATAN'S BABY" Muslim E-Mail Chain[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/images/201006/arush_hunter_01_500.jpg]==

The pictures along with a low res .3gp video of the birth of this blessed baby has been circulated among muslim Yahoo! groups in Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Pakistan as [[WTF|"Satan's Baby"]]. Apparently they haven't seen or heard of this medical condition, or their towelled heads have become an effective tinfoil hat. 

Together with the video is an inserted text message which told recepients of the baby's lulzy 'origin'. It's is told that, the baby's parents were two unmarried muslim [[Arab|Arabs]] who made a sexy time during the holy month of Ramadan in the holy city of Mecca. This was considered by God as a sin, and Satan himself got into Mom's womb and began changing the baby into his own baby. Thus, he was born as a screaming, bloody hellspawn which was promptly named Al-Lucifer. At the end of the email, the author told the recepients that [[2012|Doomsday]] is near, [[God hates fags]], god hates [[jews]] and send it to 50 recepients in your address book or the floor will turn into lava. [[Everyone|Anyone]] who refutes this email sent is promptly branded 'infidel'.
