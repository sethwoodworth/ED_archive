'''Find the Computer Room''' is a [[unfunny|dumb]] meme that originated from the [[Sonic]] message boards at [[GameFAQs]] and became popular on [[YTMND]]. The quote originated from ''Shadow the Hedgehog'' for the [[GameCube]], [[Xbox]], and [[PS2]]. The game is the same [[video game]] responsible for much Sonic fan fiction and the other GameFAQs meme '''"Where's That Damn Fourth Chaos Emerald?"''' The quote is found in a pause screen during a certain level: [[Wigger|Vector the Crocodile]] will tell you to find the computer room every time you point your cursor to his picture. It is repeated constantly and the only way to make it stop is to choose the "dark character mission."  Like "[[What is a man?]]", horrid voice acting was used.  The Internet is divided between normal people, who hate this meme, and Sonic fans, who love it.

If it's so annoying ingame, how could it be entertaining in a video?
