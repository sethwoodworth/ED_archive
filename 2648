Emogame
[[Image:Replay_Emogame.png|thumb|Emogame]]

A series of shitty flash games made to appeal to [[emos]]. Filled with hundreds of shitty 8-bit retro [[gay|male-on-male]] [[rape]] scenes, so the appeal is fairly successful.

Attempts [[hipster irony]] by having the emos in the game having ovaries or some shit like that. Neither funny nor a sufficient defense for the shittiness of emo or flash games or the squared shittiness of the combination of the two.

==Emogame 1==

[[Image:Retro_Assrape.png|thumb|Much how it feels to play Emogame.]]

Some emo band [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]] is kidnapped by another band [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]] and the members are ass - and mouthraped repeatedly. For some reason this leads to a quest rather than an all-out celebration or perhaps just a further extended period of not giving a shit.

===Emogame satirizes===

* [[Irony|Bands that exist solely to sell fashion to overweight 14-year-old girls.]]
* [[Irony|Bands that haven't allowed shitty trends to die.]]
* [[Irony|Bands that don't have any emotional relevance.]]

==Emogame 1.5==
[[Bullshit|The best of the bunch]]. But that's like saying it's the best smelling person in [[France]]. It still [[Your mom|sucks horribly]], and is granted a reprieve only because there's [[You don't have any friends|only like three]] emo[[fag]] characters.

<s>do not listen to this shit or the shit after it</s> emogame is fun, if your idea of fun is smashing your head against a brick, repeatedly.

==Emogame 2==

Similar crap, though this time the plotline is about the guy who sings the Friends theme tune being assraped and murdered by the Friends cast and then I refused to play it because I was goddamn fed up of the gay retro rape for shit's sake.

==Emogame 2.5==

RARGH OH NO [[George Bush|GEORGE BUSSH]] IS PERESIDEANT.

Emo political satire is on a similar level to Green Day's American Idiot.

== SUPER EMOGAME III ==

Basically a [[gay|glammed]] up version of all the emogames but its [[faggotry]] level is [[over 9000]]. Basically, its been in production for years now, because even [[emo]]s need money to survive.
