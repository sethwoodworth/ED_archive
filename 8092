<code>''"Daaaahhh... durrhh... uughnnmm!!"''</code><br />
:<code>~ '''Terry Schiavo, eloquent as always and DEFINITELY SENTIENT'''</code>

'''Terri Schiavo''' was a former [[ana]]/[[mia]] who went into a persistent [[Food pyramid|vegetative ]] state after a fit of [[thinspiration]]. Her vegetarianism was caused by cardiac arrest brought on by an electrolyte imbalance from her [[disorder|eating disorder]]. Her husband, Michael Schiavo, wanted to kill her from fear of voyeuristic nurses walking in on him having sex with his [[Arborphilia|vegetable wife]] in a hospice. Though she had been removed from the feeding tube, there were [[rumors]] that she seemed to be getting some [[Cum|sustenance]] after her husband's visits.

Schiavo had been a great source of [[lulz]] during March of 2005.  Her [[penis|feeding tube]] was [[sex|inserted and removed]] constantly over the years, and it required the courts and Congress to intervene, and various communities to have Schiavo-thons over that last month.

Good ol' boy Jesse Jackson even piped in to get his face back in the national media.  Arriving in a white stretch limo he made a brief speech saying that it was inhumane to not even give her water, or ice for her chapped lips, and damn, can't the bitch get a [[slurpee]]?

On October 15, 2003 the [[Florida]] legislature passed and [[Florida]] Governor Jeb [[Bush]] (who heard of Schiavo's case after watching veggie tales) signed "Terri's Law," which named her the official state [[vegetable]] of [[Florida]].

== Broken News! ==

Terri Schiavo was [[Banned IRL|permabanned irl]] on 31 March, 2005. Her parents immediately returned to court for the right to control the body. They plan to re-animate the body with hydraulic motors after previously rejecting a [[Hæti|Haitian]] priest's offer to perform a zombie resurrection ceremony on the grounds that it was against her [[Catholic]] beliefs. Her husband would most likely allow both under the condition that he can use the zombie cyborg for [[sex|his needs]].

On 15 June, 2005, the [[internets]] went berserk when the autopsy reports said what the husband was saying all along - she was just a no good two dollar [[whore]].

March 31 2005 to Eternity : Terri Schiavo's soul burns in [[hell]].

14 June 4365: Terry Schiavo is resurrected by Omegra-thong, dark alien lord of Neopets-controlled earth. In order to extract more spinal fluid from lethargic, corporate-controlled humans, he changes Schiavo into a freaky soulless vampire ghost-[[whore]] who is to star in many [[animé]]s.

==Notable LiveJournal/Internet Links==

* {{lj|user=terrischiavo}}, why does no one ask her what she wants?
* {{ljcomm|user=liberal}} has a number of fun posts on our Veggie Tales guest star, including one user who is attempting to count down to 0 the amount of Schiavo posts that get posted.
* {{ljcomm|user=conservatism}} has discussed it to a lesser standpoint, choosing to see Schiavo, with, literally, soup for brains, as a sentient being capable of recovery.  
* {{lj|user=terri_has_risen}}, seen via [[Throwingstardna]], whose gimmick is that Schiavo voted for [[George Bush]] via morse code.

* {{ljcomm|user=kill_terri}} is a community full of people who want Terri dead, so they can stop hearing about her on the news.
