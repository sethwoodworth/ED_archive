[[Image:WHERE IS BRANDON CRISP.jpg|thumb|200px|The Brandon Crisp Before...]]

'''Brandon "DJ ICE" Crisp''' was a normal [[Catholic]] boy from [[Canada|the great land of milk bags]]. He was an average boy at the age of fifteen and attended a Catholic high school where he learned about God and fellatio. Brandon had a rather unhealthy relationship with his [[Xbox 360|Xbox]], skipping school to play ''[[Call of Duty 4|Call of Duty]]'' all day long. On October 13th, he had a fight with his parents and his parents decided to take his [[Xbox 360|Ecksbawks]]. Suffering from immense amounts of [[butthurt]], he threatened to pack his bags and move in with his auntie and uncle in [[Bel-Air]]. His father played along with his son's sudden outburst of [[unwarranted self-importance]] and helped him pack his bags (though forgetting to throw in some medipacks). He was later quoted that, "[[Did it for the lulz|He had done it for the lulz]]." Brandon's black person tactics kept him alive briefly, until he joined forces with [[Jake Roberts]] and [[failed]] the final level in his favorite [[MMORPG]] called ''Fallout Tree'', by climbing up a tree and attempting to swan dive to the nearest branch. In a sudden realization that he was not fit or had an ounce of parkour skills, Brandon plummeted to Final Stand and took the coward's way out. Before the Game Masters could find his body, [[Facebook]] [[fail|campaigns]] with [[over 9,000]] people were formed. And with a lot of [[Christians|moralfags]], comes [[b|a lot of trolls]].

Brandon Crisp was appointed [[An hero|an Xbox hero]] on the [[V for Vendetta|5th of November]] by [[Internet|internet's]] super heroes, /b/. His death was almost as lulzy as [[An Wiiro]], but with the powers of online communities, moar lulz were had when /b/ started to leave their [[flame|condolences]] on Facebook.

Brandon was a tiny, [[Angry Homo Kid|angry]], [[retarded]] Canadian kid, though some say he was a [[pretty cool guy]]. He enjoyed watching the movies ''Ice Age'', ''Out Cold'', ''Brain Freeze'', ''[[Pauly shore|Encino Man]]'', ''In Cold Blood'', ''The Big Chill'', ''Jack Frost'', ''Cold Mountain'', ''Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero'', ''The Ice Storm'', and ''Frozen River''. Unfortunately, he was not a fan of ''Man vs. Wild'' or that Canadian show ''Survivorman''. Brandon enjoyed listening to "Cold as Ice" by Foreigner, "North to [[Sarah Palin|Alaska]]" by [[Old|Johnny Horton]], "Ice Ice Baby" by [[wigger|Vanilla Ice]], "Stone Cold Crazy" by [[Gay|Queen]], "The Iceman Cometh" by Impelliterri, "So Cold" by [[Faggot|Breaking Benjamin]], "World So Cold" by [[Screamo|Mudvayne]], The album ''Alaska'' by Between The Buried And Me, anything with [[Ice Cube|Ice Cube]] or Ice T in it, and pretty much anything by [[emo|Coldplay]], Cold War Kids, or [[Black Metal|Imperial Crystalline Entombment]] (also known as I.C.E., lulz). When Brandon was feeling classy, he'd listen to Vivaldi's "Winter", Westlake's "Antarctica Suite" but he never listened to Stravinsky's "Danse Inferne". His favorite play was Eugene O'Neill's ''The Iceman Cometh''. Crisp disliked [[Rap|Snoop Dogg's "Drop It Like It's Hot"]], black person "Fire", [[Shit|Nelly's "Hot In Here"]], and [[Aspie|Jim Gaffigan's]] "Hot Pockets" routine. He also loved the wrestling antics of Stone Cold Steve Austin.

[[Some argue|There is speculation]] that Brandon was just following his Dad's orders when he was told to [[Pun|"go chill out"]]. [[Some argue|It has also been reported]] that Brandon enjoyed [[Cosplay|dressing as Mr. Freeze]] [[I did it for the lulz|for Halloween]]. It is also speculated that if Brandon Crisp and [[Codey Porter]] combine their powers, Captain Planet will return. We have also gotten word that his favorite Bing Crosby movie was ''White Christmas''. It is also possible that he got auto-balanced and is now somewhere in [[Russia]].

==The Argument==

[[Image:Crisp_SP.PNG|thumb|The Brandon Crisp story, in ''[[South Park]]'' style.]]

Brandon, like any [[13 year old boy]] got exceedingly [[butthurt|upset]] when he was told by his father that his [[Xbox 360]] was being confiscated due to his [[School|schoolwork]] suffering, and as with all teen arguments, this resulted in a [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|large amount]] of [[drama]] and he told his parents he was [[Bel-Air|moving with his Auntie and Uncle in Bel-Air]], Brandon's dad being the [[Dumbass|responsible parent]] he even [[gtfo|helped his son to pack his bags]] in a true gesture of [[Josef Fritzl|fatherly love]]. Having never played ''[[Oregon Trail]]'' as a child, Brandon [[Fail|failed]] to know what to do when confronted with the choice of leaving. Thus, he bought [[om nom|no oxen, bacon, meat, dried fruits and vegetables, whiskey]], or winter coats but rather twelve grandfather clocks. Pity.

Mr. Crisp told [[Faux News|journalists]] he expected to see him back within a few hours, or at worst, the next day. Upon receiving news of his son's [[An hero|death]], Mr. Crisp organized a huge [[Party girl|party]] and invited all his friends and neighbors round for some [[pizza and beer|nibbles and fine wine]], then returned Brandon's birthday gift, ironically a new coat. After all, no longer having to put up with Brandon's [[faggotry|attitude]] was cause to [[Party Hard|celebrate]], [[amirite|right]]?

==Memorial Songs & CopyPasta==

{{cs2|realstory|The Real Story|
<pre>
I'm a member of the search and rescue squad that was deployed to find Brandon Crisp. I had never 
dealt with a serious case like this before; the kid was young, not exactly an outdoorsman from what 
I understood, and he'd been lost for weeks in Canadian fall/winter weather. Of course we never told 
the parents, but we were looking for a corpse, not a little boy.
Not knowing the land around Barrie nearly as well as some of my fellow investigators, I resigned 
myself to the fact that I was comparatively useless and would probably end up covering much less 
ground than my coworkers. Nevertheless, I bundled up warm and set out. I decided to do some 
searching east of Barrie, since most of the area to the north and west had been thoroughly scoured 
for any signs of human life.

After maybe an hour of searching, I found an old, abandoned farmhouse. I inspected the house, which 
didn't look like it had been used for decades, and couldn't find any footprints. I briefly glanced 
inside each room, perfunctorily shouting Brandonâ€™s name. He was nowhere to be found. I was 
disappointed, since that had seemed like the best lead yet. A farmhouse would have been an 
excellent place for a kid on the run to hide from frosty winds and the bitter elements.

---

I continued my search, heading further east. I looked for footprints, snapped twigs, any manmade 
items that might have been discarded by the boy. All I could find was a broken branch sitting next 
to a bark-stripped tree, which,unless Brandon had very peculiar tastes, meant only that there was a 
deer somewhere in those desolate woods. So Iheard a faint sound u liek mudkipz, almost like 
grunting, echoing through the trees. It sounded vaguely human, andI tried my best to follow the 
reverberating noises. There was an equally good chance that it was some meaner sortof creature, 
though, so I drew my pistol cautiously. I ran as softly as I could towards what I hoped were 
the echoing grunts.

Finally, I came upon a break in the trees. I carefully approached the clearing, trying to see what 
I was up against before making any sort of movement. Finally i came up to the clearing , dropped my 
pants and unloaded a steamer into his mouth before cumming to the sight of my boyfriend's tiny cock.
</pre>|0}}{{cs2|brandonsnowman|Brandon the Snowman|

Brandon The snowman,
was a jolly happy soul,
With a 360 and COD4,
And a lot of time online,

Brandon the snowman,
Will be missed they say,
He was frozen in snow,
Now the children know,
Not to run away.

There must have been a tree,
In the Barrie wilderness,
For when he fell down and hit his head,
He began to bleed out!

Brandon the snowman,
was dead as he could be,
And the children say,
He couldn't play,
COD4.

Brandon the snowman,
Knew the snow fell that day,
So he began to run,
And had some fun,
Before he met his frozen grave

4km from the village,
With a controller in his hand,
Falling here and there,
Out of the trees,
Saying Devil may care,

Brandon the snowman,
died alone and cold,
I bet he cried,
for his Xbox live,
As his blood stopped moving.

|0}}{{cs2|belair|Bel-Air, Ode to An Hero|

Now this is the story all about how
I died naked & frozen up-side-down
I'd like to take a minute just sit right there,
I'll tell you how taking my XBOX was completely unfair

In west Ontario, born and raised
On CoD4 was where I spent most of my days
Shootin' down choppers and scannin' so cool
Just killin' some Russians right after school
When a couple of n00bs who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I played for one week straight and my Dad got scared
He said, "Run away forever and see if I care!"

I rode off on my bike, and then it was clear
The tires went flat and a chain broke in my gear
I could still see my house, I could go back there?
But I thought, "Nah, forget it, my 'rents are unfair!"

I fell into the snow around 7 or 8
And I yelled to my team, "Hey guys, I'll respawn later!"
I looked for some cover, but nothing was there
And that's why takin' my XBOX was completely unfair.

|0}}{{cs2|willsurvive|I WILL SURVIVE... so he thought|

At first I was annoyed
I was mystified
Kept thinking I could never live
without Xbox by my side
But I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to run away
and now I'm gone!
From this shit place!
I just walked out and left you there
with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed my stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key 
If I had known for just one second
you'd be back to steal CoD

I've gone on now, walked out the door
I won't turn around now
'cause you stole my CoD4
Weren't you the one, that wouldn't let me have my fucking games?
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd stay in my room and cry!?
Oh no, not I
I will just die
As long as I don't have any of newbs to pwn
I know I can't stay alive
I've got all my life to game
I've got all my skills to pwn
But I won't survive!
I won't survive!

It took all the strength I had
not to go back home
Kept trying hard to mend
the pieces of my broken soul
and I spent oh so many nights
just feeling sorry for my team
oh how I cried
Now I can feel my eye's grow tired
and you can't see me
Nobody knew
I'm not that chained up l33t gamer
still in love with Xbox live
And so I felt like sitting down
and resting my head down in the snow
Now I'm freezing in this field, becoming an hero

|0}}{{cs2|zombies|No, Brandon, you are the Xbox|

Brandon Crisp waited. 

The Xbox was disconnected right in front of him. His parents carried it from the room. He didn't 
see it, but had expected it now for years. 

His warnings to Captain Price were not listened to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway. 
Brandon had played Tour of Duty 4 for fifteen years. When he was young he watched the consoles and he said to 
dad "I want to play on the consoles daddy." 

Dad said "No! You will be FROZEN IN THE WOODS". There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. 
But now in his bedroom he knew he had to escape. 

"This is Price" the radio crackered. "You must run away!" So Brandon gotted his bike and ran off without a coat. 

"HE GOING TO GET FROZEN" said the onlookers 

"I will freeze him" said the weather and it fired snow at him. Brandon climbed up at him and tried to dodge him. 
But then the snow fell and they were trapped and not able to kill. 

"No! I must get my Xbox" he shouted. The radio said "No, Brandon. You are the Xbox." And then Brandon was frozen.

Hey Ultranationalists,

My name is Brandon, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are slow, inaccurate n00bs who spend every second of their day getting knifed in the back by me, Brandon. You are everything cold in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten level 55? I mean, I guess it's fun losing to a 15 year old because you're a faggot, but you all take it to a whole new level. This is even worse then jerking off to my obituaries on Facebook.

Don't be a Spetznaz. Just hit me with your best airstrike. I'm pretty much frozen. I was leader of the scoreboards, and beaten by my dad. What games do you play, other than "not freeze to death in the woods"? I also get RROD, and have a pretty warm jacket (Just lost it; I am SO cold). You are all losers who should buy a better bike next time. Thanks for searching.

I can guarantee u this hanry loser will get a nice awakening when the Crisp family and/or facebook reports him to the police. Get ready for a knock on ur door, cuffs, sitting in a police car, getting put in a holding cell & being denied bail. If the family has any say whatsoever hopefully the crown will throw u straight to prison to smarten up! Enjoy being prepared to be humilated and bashed in the court room. Ill make sure Im notified from the Crisp family when to attend & smile seeing u charged for ur disgusting behaviour.

Hunters found his body in teh woods. Let's examine the fucking facts here: His bike was found not far from his house, there are no strangers in that area and he has [[Sad|no friends]]; how the FUCK could you be that much of a failure as to die just as you get 2 blocks from your [[house]]? His parents are obviously [[Murder|The Killers]]. They reported the incident so as not to attract suspicion. The only other possibility is that he An Hero'd via hanging on a branch, trying to evade [[Shotacat]].

'''Possibilities''': 

* An hero
* Killed by parents
* Bear trap
* Jack Frost
* Hypothermia
* tripped on a stick
* [[lolwut|carbon monoxide]]
* El Chupacabra
* Gaz
* [[Shotacat]]
* [[AIDS]]
* Being mistaken for a deer and subsequently shot by [[W|Dick Cheney]]
* Thinking he could not get affected by weather like in video games.
* '''FROZEN TO A CRISP'''
