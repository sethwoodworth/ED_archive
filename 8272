Mulberry High School cheerleader, [http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=312823289&MyToken=dc87f8a5-8238-48d5-a971-ff0bb335523f Victoria Lindsay] was beaten by eight of her classmates after she left what '''the Mulberry Eight''' [http://mulberryeight.blogspot.com/] called [[serious business|"a mean message"]] on their [[MySpace]] accounts. The entire incident was videotaped and the eight Florida Polk County teens planned to post it on YouTube. However, once they forgot the password to their [[AOL]] account they deleted their [[system32]] instead.

Essentially '''TME''' are not [[YouTube]] famous; at least not yet. The video, filmed March 30 2008, shows 16-year-old Vicky being attacked by six cheerleader sluts while two boys stood as [[spy|lookouts]]. Lindsay was backed into a corner while the attackers blocked the door way. She suffered several blows to the head, loss of vision and hearing in her left side and was knocked unconscious after being slammed into a wall. Not since the [[YouTube Rape Video]] has the viewing public been so engaged with an event that sorta happened but really didn't. Not surprisingly, [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]] and undoubtedly (according to Mercades Nichols) "[[niggers]]" are to blame.

According to the [http://www.myspace.com/polkcountysheriffsoffice sheriff's office], the video (which was never uploaded by the teens) bespeaks the "[[Anonymous|pack mentality]]" and "[[/b/|animalistic behavior]]" provoked by the Internet. Tori Lindsay's parents also blamed online companies. "As far as I am concerned, MySpace is the [[Jesus|anti-Christ]] for children," her father told ''The Ledger'', a local newspaper. "I hope this comes to a [[final solution|final resolution]]. I am not going to stop here." 

Nobody seems to point out the obvious fact that the [[internets]] was never designed to be used by inbred [[rednecks]] and is far too sophisticated for low intelligence species to fully comprehend.

==Dr. Phil Dips His Wick==

A producer for the tv show ''[[Doctor Phil|Dr. Phil]]'' posted the $33,000 bail for Mercades Nichols. Upon her release, Mercades and her family were instructed to remain silent and the producer proudly (and repeatedly) proclaimed that Dr. Phil now has exclusive rights to her story and any [[fellatio|sexual act]] he wishes her to perform. It is still unconfirmed whether her whore mother will also be offering [[anal|her services]] to the old koot.

[http://www.hollywoodgrind.com/tag/mercades-nichols/ See the release video here]

The staff of ''Dr. Phil'', in an epic display of backpeddling and faggotry, have since cancelled plans to air this story. "A spokeswoman for host Phil McGraw, Terri Corigliano, did not respond to phone messages and an e-mail sent by The Associated Press on Sunday. In an e-mail Saturday night, Corigliano wrote that "certain staff members went beyond our guidelines" in paying the bond.

"These staff members have been spoken to and our policies reiterated," she wrote. "In addition, we have decided not to go forward with the story as our guidelines have been compromised."

==/b/ Reacts==
[[image:MulberryEightonB.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The beginning of one of several threads]]
Naturally, the video and related news stories were posted on [[b|niggertits.com]]. [[Dox]] were quickly obtained from the original [[Digg]] thread and phone harassment was initiated, with the mother of one of the guilty [[cunt]]s screaming into the phone that she was adding the caller's number to a list to give to police. Hope you used a [[proxy]], Anon! Evidently she was getting, let's say, an unusual number of phone calls for 2 AM. 

A few [[anon]]s accused the raiders of [[moralfag|moralfaggotry]] and tried to start a counter raid of the [[victim]]'s family, but the vast majority of /b/tards understood that a [[hawt]] girl had been violated by [[fatties]], and that this could not stand. Some [[Newfags]] tried to stop the raiding altogether by advancing the [[stupid]] argument that raids "shouldn't affect people in real life", but they were quickly shouted down and ordered to [[Gaia|GB2GAIA]].

'''"DON'T HIT THE SHELF!"''' from the Youtube video attained brief [[meme]] status.
