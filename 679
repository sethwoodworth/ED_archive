According to [[moar]] recent research Atlantis could be:
#[[New Orleans]]
#The [[old]]est Space Shuttle in the [[world]] except for ''Enterprise'' and ''Discovery'', and ''Challenger'' and ''Columbia'', except the last two crashed and so they don’t count.
#A ''Stargate'' spinoff starring [[Amanda Wenk]].
#A tropical resort and hotel in [[the Bahamas]] featuring a large marine habitat, marina, Marine Girl, some water attractions, a spa, a casino, and a large conference center (according to [[the Google]]).
#A level in the computer games ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' and ''[[The Sims]]''.
#A legendary island first mentioned in the [[2001]] [[Disney]] movie ''Atlantis: The [[Lost]] Empire''.
#Mythical place of sea monkeys and waffles. AKA [[Belgium]]
#An Ancient Aryan Civilization inn the Black and/or Caspian sea/s before the sea level rose.
#[[Shit nobody cares about]]

At one point [[Nazis]] believed that they had originated from Atlantis, although this remains unconfirmed.
Also, Atlantis doesn't exist. Plato Specifically said that it was hypothetical as a way for him to get his point across.
