=Forgettable Reviewers (Moar than 5000 subs)=



Forgettable reviewers - The Z list e-celebs of Youtube. Either by sucking the dicks of the retro gaming clique or by freak luck, these douche-bags have managed to amass over 5,000 Youtube subscriptions. Please take a good look at these abominations. It's imperative their crimes against good taste and decency do not go unnoticed. They must be stopped.

[[Image:26yearoldvirgin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|AkewsticRockR]]

Kyle J. Hendrickson AKA AkewsticRockR AKA [[The Office|Rainn Wilson's]] long lost bastard love-child, is a YouTube [[christian]] who breaks many of [[God]]'s laws on a frequent basis and is clearly going to Hell when he dies. AkewsticRockR is guilty of making a constant practice of the sins of [[Unwarranted self importance|pride]], [[BAW|wrath]], [[hypocrisy]], [[fag|homosexuality]], lying, and not loving thy neighbors like he loves himself (and he loves himself a lot). Despite all of this, AkewsticRockR is happy to preach to any and all who say a single curse-word on youtube about his or her sins and how they are to be condemned for it.

AkewsticRockR's main hobbies include sucking up to [[Talentless|Lisa Nova]], criticizing everyone on YouTube for being sinners (the majority of which are saints compared to AkewsticRockR),  dissecting other users' videos (picking out the minutest and most insignificant of imperfections) and generally pointing out to everyone at any opportunity that he's now a [[Attention whore|"Youtube Partner"]].<br> 

AkewsticRockR started out on YouTube by plagiarizing the Angry Video Game Nerd's TMNT review in a horribly unfunny, [[Censorship|Christian BAWfest]]. His subsequent videos have proven equally talentless. He used to have [[Flame Wars|Youtube warz]] with another basement dweller by the name of [[Video Game Reviewers#Undercoverfilmer00v|Undercoverfilmer00v]], but UCF became [[butthurt]] from the constant bitching from AkewsticRockR and fucked off from Youtube, thus ending the [[lulz]].  

He tried to start another war with [[Video Game Reviewers#LeisureSuitGaming / Silent Rob|Silent Rob]], a talentless, [[Butthurt|butthurt]], [[Anorexic|emaciated]] [[Redneck|hick]] who never leaves his mother's attic. Targetting Rob, (a [[moar|moar]] [[Basement-dweller|popular]] [[faggot|reviewer]]) would seem like a good shot at publicity, but since Rob black person into his [[shit|videos]], nothing [[rape|interesting]] happened.

===[[Angry Video Game Nerd|The Angry Video Game Nerd]]===
[[Image:Nerdpukedo7.gif|thumb|left|The Angry Video Game Nerd]]

Previously known as the Angry Nintendo Nerd, the Angry Video Game Nerd, or AVGN, arguably started the whole video game reviewer fad (though ironically he [[irate gamer|ripped off]] [[Seanbaby]]) and is probably the most known of them all. However, he is now the internet's equivalent of [[The Simpsons]]: Stopped being funny several years ago, and seriously needs to fuck off. 

The AVGN pretends to suck at games and then throws them out a window and/or does something unfunny. More known characteristics include a shitty theme song, cussing, and references to [[furrys|animals]]. 

He's also gone a bit shit in recent times due to him solely reviewing games of movie tie-ins.<small>The preceding statement was added by [[Guru Larry]], his former co-worker. Jealousy lulz.</small> 

The Nerd sold out big time when he started auctioning off shit featured in his videos on eBay. These worthless items, including signed, broken NES carts, were lapped up for stupid money by his [[douchebag]] [[fanboys]].

The Nerd is also known for his limited vocabulary, including many [[Lie|classic]] quotes such as:<br> 
''What a shitload of fuck!'';
''Cowafucking Piece of dog shit!'';
''Fuck this shit...'';
''Fuck!'';
''Shit!'';
''AASSS!'';
''FUUUCK!'';
''Damn!'';
''It sucking fucks, it fucking sucks, it's a piece of shit!, and I don't like it.''<br> 
And pretty much every other swear word in the dictionary. All of which have since been stolen by other video game reviewers to the point they're now cliché and completely lost all meaning.<br><br>

[[Image:Armake21.jpg|thumb|left|Armake21]]

Marcus Sparacio, also known as NicotineAlien for a short while before getting his ass b& ''(and now BoxedEntertainment21)'', [[Armake21]] is an overrated, slap-headded, [[virgin|25-year-old virgin]] game reviewer who can't review for shit. He just attempts to swear at them for ten minutes in his wispy Winnie the Pooh voice.  Armake21's most recognizable feature is his uncanny talent of growing hair on the wrong side of his head.<br> 

[[Fanboy|Fagboys]] got [[butthurt]] when Armake21's account was [[Anonymous|mysteriously]] closed, and all videos were [[party hard|removed]]. It has been confirmed that his account has been closed by himself in an [[emo]] [[attention whore|sympathy vote]].<br> 

His new account, [http://www.youtube.com/user/BoxedEntertainment21 BoxedEntertainment21], still contains the same three year old reviews and constant empty threats of never doing any more reviews (in his favorite flavor: White text in an Impact font on a black background). [[Fanboy|Fanbois]] now wait for reuploads of his [[shit|awesome]] game reviews so they can go back to [[masturbating|jerking off]] to his older works instead of choking on Armake's [[cock]].

===[[Talentless|ConsoleVania / VideoGaiden]] ===
[[Image:ConsoleVaniaTalentlessScottishCunts.jpg|thumb|left|ConsoleVania / VideoGaiden<br>''(Left) Rab Florence''<br>''(Right) Ryan McCloud'']]

ConsoleVania ''(otherwise known as VideoGaiden in it's watered down [[BBC]] guise)'' is a series presented by a pair of arrogant, pretentious, egocentric, self-obsessed [[Scotland|Scottish]] twats, who unwarrantly proclaimed themselves to be the saviours of video gaming on the internet and [[British]] television, but ended up failing on a level of epic 9/11 proportions due to their own narcissism.

Presented by ''Robert Florence'', The bastard love child of a shaved bear and [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=rab+c+nesbitt&spell=1 ''Rab C. Nesbit''], & ''Ryan McCloud'', The stereotypical quieter, even less talented hanger-on. The two [[Scottish|Jocks]] stumble around screen attempting to be funny in sketches, whilst occasionally reviewing a video game for 10 seconds with a slew of profanities when they can be bothered.

One day, some [[Retarded|highly innovative]] BBC producer ''(whom, coincidentally turned out to be a friend)'' knocked on their door asking if they could air their [[shit|quality entertainment]] on "BBC2 Scotland" at a time when everyone is in bed asleep (Sunday at midnight).  Rab and Ryan's ego went through the roof proclaiming that their program would be the greatest gaming TV show on British Television since [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=gamesmaster GamesMaster] (which admittedly isn't that hard to so considering all gaming TV shows are shit anyway by default). Unfortunately, what they produced turned out to be a 30 minute sketch show of them desperately trying to be recognised as comedians and a foot-in-the-door on TV and completely ignored the fact that it was supposed to be a show that reviews video games. 

The BBC dumped them off regional television airwaves completely for the third series when they realised that it was genuinely shit, no-one watched it (not even Scottish insomniacs) & ran it on a tiny sub-section of their Scottish website instead.  Rab and Ryan valiantly claimed that ''"TV is dead"'' in a poor measure to save face, days before the BBC pulled the plug all-together. Nowadays, Rab enjoys pointing out how much more talented he is compared to other video game reviewers and Gaming TV presenters to his small legion of ass-kissing fanboys on his forum, occasionally making a [[Crap|high quality]] video for [[YouTube]] that [[nobody|everyone]] watches, Whilst Ryan still hangs on to him like a dried piece of shit on a pubic hair.

Undoubtedly one of his trolls will notice this article in due course, which'll make Rab go off on a [[butthurt]] rant all over again about how much better than everyone else he is.

===Classic Game Room / InecomCompany===
[[File:Classis Game Room.jpg|thumb|left|Classic Game Room,<br> ''Mark Bussler (Left)<br>& The other one (right)'']]
Long before all these shitty reviewers on Youtube, Long before the AVGN and even long before [[Seanbaby]], There was Classic Game Room (or Game Room as they were back then).  An internet video game video review show from the mid 90's that no-one watched due to a combination of no-one having the internet back then and even if you did, you wouldn't wait three hours to stream a three minute video of someone making fun of Dreamcast games would you?

But with the advent of Youtube,  the Game Room team decided to resurrect their 90's show to a new generation ALA NavGtr, only slightly less bat shit insane. 

Unfortunately, while their original series is pretty funny.  Since the advent of "Classic" Game Room, and one of the original members deciding to do something worthwhile with his life, all notability went out of the window and and anyone who subscribes to them is bombarded with a million fucking reviews each day,  and when Bussler isn't reviewing a hundred games an hour he's either making videos about his freakish mongrel of a dog or pouring beer from a first person perspective all whilst slapping adverts left, right and center on his videos like a typical Youtube Partner whore.

Although totally devoid of E-Drama (aside from Still Gaming Lee's constant duck suckery) they make a worthy mention for their sheer bombardment of videos that they put up faster than a 10 year old Let's Player.

[[Image:TheGamingGoose.jpg|thumb|left|TheGamingGoose]]

The Gaming Goose is a hard reviewer to explain,  he's best described as a mass of [[fat|blubber]] and [[unix beard|beard]] all wrapped up in a T-Shirt that reviews [[Nintendo|NES]] games and cheap-o PS2 shit he finds in bargain bins.  

He often talks about [[fag|male penetrative sex]] in his reviews, but then moved onto making "Let's Plays", ''(which ironically, is even more fucking [[gay]])'', Luckily, he has since come to his senses and has emerged as a legitimate troll of the video game community. His constant parodies of many [[drama queen|reviewers]] has generated marginal amounts of lulz out of the situation, most notably when he recently attacked  [[Armake21]]'s arrogant, self-obsessed [[tl;dr]] comments on an, [[irony|ironically]], [[tl;dw]] video.

He is one of the more tolerable persons on this list, but that's like comparing smallpox to consumption.

===[[USI|Gamester81]]===

[[Image:Gamester81.jpg|thumb|left|Gamester81]]

A typical "I'm Mr Nice Guy", gut wrenching [[Youtube]] [[douchebag]]. This guy boasts a massive! collection of [[retro]] hardware, which if it wasn’t for his smugness might even be slightly interesting to see. Gamester81 is one of those guys that gives shout-outs but then likes to blow himself after for being so "nice". After all, it's about the "community" maaan.
His douchebaggery recently reached new heights with him giving e-interviews (who the fuck made him Larry King anyway?) and holding suspiciously timed prize giveaways that just happen to coincide with his partnership application...funny that.
Not content with one [[wack]] channel, Gamester81 has two others which he constantly whores out. I tell you, watching this guy's huge [[Shrek]] style head fill the screen combined with his smug way is enough to put anyone off Youtube for life. Consider yourselves warned. This guy has a big dose of [[butthurt]] coming his way.

Update: Gamester81 had mentioned that he was applying for a Youtube partnership, solely so he could break the 10 minute time limit, he said at the time. He's now a full partner, and guess what people? None of his vids are longer, but nearly all of them have add-sense activated on them now - Odd that... and he said it wasn't about the money. So he blatantly lied to his viewers then? I urge you, please go to this guy's channel and troll the fuck out of him at your earliest convenience. 

This guy is a master at self promotion, and like most typical Youtube partner whores, only cares about add revenue, lame e-celeb status and getting his fucking check off the [[Google]] [[pimp daddy]]. Now his obviously cynical motives for starting his channel(s) are paying off for him. Read between the lines with this guy and you'll see behind the mask. This guy is one [[fugly]] bastard too, and watching his fat sausage like fingers fumbling over beautiful retro systems makes you feel kind of bad for the consoles.

David "GreatExpectations320" Torok is the type of person that [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] was made for. His videos and hurt ego proved that he is a wannabe [[emo]], some preteen Jew who doesn't know what he's talking about and thus is just another unfunny [[13 year old]] youtube user who reviews 20 year old NES games that no one cares about.  Embarrassing the video game community on a scale that wouldn't be emulated until [[Chadwardenn]], he got PWNED by anyone of any sex, age, race, or creed within a 50 mile radius of an internet connection. 

David "greatexpectations320" Torok has only a handful of fans, yet that's [[moar]] than enough to make him think that he's super popular and funny, therefore making him [[serious business]].

Your typical [[basement dwelling]] [[nerd]]...on [[steroids]]!

Anthony (Jedite1) was once looked up to as a [[God|God-like]] reviewer by [[noone|his fellow YouTubers]]. Despite this, his reviews were basically the same thing as the Angry Video Game Nerd's, but with an annoying nasal voice, a slight lisp and a stutter. He then made Q&A videos, answering questions from his followers, which were also full of fail as he took at least thirty minutes to answer one question. Mysteriously disappeared from les tubes, only to return to show off his now muscular arms and pecs, as well as rant over the [[butthurt]] going on around les tubes. Buttbudies with [[Spax3]].

=== [[LeisureSuitGaming|LeisureSuitGaming / Silent Rob]] ===
[[File:SilentWank.gif|thumb|250px|left|Silent Rob]]

AKA The Ginger Whinger,  Silent Rob is a [[hardcore]] [[ITG|internets tough guy]] who is more known nowadays for his [[BAWWW|whiny emo diatribes]] than his [[fuck|"fuck"-fests]] in disguise as video game reviews. He got his start as an [[unfunny|extremely overrated]] game "reviewer" best known for his Action 52 review, which was, shockingly, worse than the game was in all aspects. But after sucking [[Damien Estreich|Damien Estreich's]] cock enough in the attempt to receive a [[The Kewl Kids|YouTube Partnership and the featuring of his videos on the main page]], Mr. Estrech refused to give it to him, deeming his [[shit|work]] [[truth|unoriginal]]. 

This is when Silent Rob [[butthurt|busted down the floodgates]] and spent ten minutes bitching about the [[Irate Gamer]], in which his arguments, for every small truth they may have had, were cockblocked by at least fifteen references to IG "[[blowjob|loving the cock]]" per truth. His [[fanboy|fanbase]], being as intelligent as [[lemmings]], followed his orders and started hating the reviewer, spawning a great, yet pathetic, amount of [[lulz|proxy lulz]] that still lingers to this day.

Rob has still not gotten over the butthurt of not becoming a YouTube Partner. Seeing the likes of the [[AVGN]], [[That Guy With The Glasses]], and [[Yahtzee]] [[Internet poor|making money hands over fists]], he has since gotten into [[internet panhandling]] by [[Geocities|creating his own website]] devoted to his poorly-made, unfunny [[abortion|abortions]] that he calls videos. 

But [[Snape kills Dumbledore|this story has a twist]]: [[facepalm|He charges people $5 just to visit it]]. He has rightfully suffered backlash from his [[13-year-old|loyal followers]], finally seeing how shitty his work really is. The ensuing lulz that has resulted from Silent Rob's butthurt and subsequent bawwwing about the website can be best described as the funniest thing that man has ever done.

Rob also boasts that he fucked [http://www.youtube.com/user/bookittty182 some female game reviewer] [[IRL]]. Not that it means much.

===[[A_frank_discussion_of_mental_illness|SashaNein / Still Gaming]]===
[[Image:SashaNeinbiggar.jpg|thumb|left|SashaNein / StillGaming]]

SashaNein, ''(Also known as "Still Gaming")'' initially appears to to a sensible, rational human being, with well thought out video game reviews and agreeable points on mid-80's to early-90's technology, but instead turns out to be a complete and utter fucking nut-job wacko.

He suffers from a severe case of hypochondria, in his case a crippling stomach pain which makes him incapable of making reviews for months at a time, but bizarrely also allows him to make countless "vlogs" describing his symptoms constantly to gain [[emo|sympathy votes]].

When SashaNein's not making videos about his stomach illness, He enjoys [[fag|taking it up the ass]] from [http://www.youtube.com/user/PBCProductions PBC Productions], [http://www.youtube.com/user/InecomCompany Classic Game Room] and [[That Guy With The Glasses]] as he can never get through one fucking video or paragraph without sucking up to them at least twice.  ''(though being their bitch may actually explain his constant stomach pains)''.

SashaNein also is the only person on [[YouTube]] to suffer from pretend [[Stephen Hawking|Lou Garrick's disease]], as he has never appeared moving on screen, he's only seen in a collection of awkward poses to slightly lessen the monotony of his rants. <br><br>

SashaNein has, on rare occasions, shown the potential to be a good source of [[e-drama]] as he becomes agitated and defensive quite easily. Whether it's fending off criticism of his derivative and mediocre work, or [[pussy-whipped|standing up for]] his whale of a [[Slut|fiance]] Dena after revealing herself to be a [[furry]]. These events did not nearly create as much [[lulz]] as they could have due to his show being of such little noteworthiness at the time they simply flew under the radar.

[[Image:Doctor_Insano.JPG|thumb|left|He tried to get this pitched for a kid's show, not kidding.]]
[[Image:Picture27b.png|thumb|ED IS NOT ALLOW]]

SpoonyOne is another run-of-the-mill video game reviewer on YouTube, but there is one big difference: he was actually funny at one point. He started out as your typical YouTube reviewer, but emerged as a great with his effective trolling of the [[Final Fantasy]] community with his reviews bashing [[Final Fantasy VIII]]. As fanboys of the series were [[butthurt]] by these [[truth|outright lies]], it sparked wave after wave of lulzy comments and replies talking about how he's a [[/v/|/v/irgin]] that [[hypocrite|will never get laid]].

Since then, Spoony has tried his hand at other forms of entertainment. Sadly, none of them were very good. Most of his normal reviews that have time and effort put into them may provide some [[Lulz|laughs]], but sadly Spoony is not competent enough to produce a regularly satisfying quality of work that is capable of entertaining anyone but the most [[Retarded|devoted]] [[aspies|fans]]. Among these failed attempts at humor and entertainment Spoony has spent particularly shameful stretches of time where he revisits the lazy man's way of [[Attention Whore|recording oneself playing videogames for the internet]] known as the atrocious "Let's Play" trend, his insufferably unfunny alter ego known as [[Trying Too Hard|Doctor Insano]], his affiliation with the sinkhole of internet talent known as [[That Guy With The Glasses|That Guy With The Glasses]]/[[Unfunny|Blistered]] [[Shit|Thumbs]] along with the constant [[Circle jerk|get-togethers]] and [[crossovers]] they require their members to partake in, the insipid "Game/Movie in [[Lazy|5 Seconds]]" series which appeals greatly to his aforementioned tendencies to put as little effort as possible into the majority of his work, and his near constant [[Nerd Rage|vlogs]] which are little more than watching a bitter manchild sit in his room and whine incessantly or drone on about [[Shit Nobody Cares About|something]] that does not warrant getting in front of a camera to talk about for upwards of [[TL;DW|30-40 minutes]]. Coincidentally, these horrid vlogs now account for the majority of the content Spoony is producing.

A word of advice: [[moar|Troll moar]]. Then you will become an [[winrar]] and indeed [[You win the prize|win the prize]].

'''''WHOA NOW! E-DRAMA AHOY!'''''

Since he muscled out all the other nerds and won the Mashable "Funniest Person to Follow"-title, viewers were expecting some kind of celebratory speech. 
What they got, however, was a two-page written [[Waaaambulance|rant]], lashing out at his fans for not liking his [[crossover]] collaborations with TGWTG, blaming all the viewers for the butthurt the criticism has caused among his neckbeard Blistered Thumbs buddies, and telling his fans to "just fucking leave my site if they don't like it". Apparently his acceptance speech got trolled by fans of the other contestants so he flipped the fuck out on EVERYBODY. [[HA_HA_HA,_OH_WOW|Ha Ha, Oh Wow]], talk about moodswings! For a guy who's claim to fame is trolling FF fanboys he sure has some [[Sensitive|frail nerves]].

Now called "LazyWorkCreations" (should have been Lazy'''WOK'''Creations [[Amirite?]]) because the stupid bastard forgot his old Youtube password, he now fills his account with Q&A's that contain answers to questions noone asked, videos of his friends at college getting pissed off with a slitty-eyed fucker shoving a camera in their face constantly and clips of him playing Beta/Demo versions of PS3 games because his immigrant welfare check won't cover a full game. 
He currently spends his wasted life on the Spoony Experiment forums spamming his shitty videos and constantly crying about how he will never be a popular, recognized reviewer.

Although not the same kind of game reviewer as the above, he still deserves a mention for being such a (as other Britfags would call him) [[Londoner|southern twat]].	
	 		
Basically, take your most [[Gay|pompous]] and [[Asshole|egotistical]] [[Britfag]], make a bunch of MS Paint slides, have him talk over them, speed up the audio, and you have instant [[Fail|comedy gold]]. Think the [[Angry Video Game Nerd|AVGN]] except with a few more brain cells, no access to a video camera, and reviewing new games instead of old ones. He used to review fairly [[Shit|poor]] games, but now has taken it upon himself to troll the [[Aspies|easily upset]] [[fanboys]] of recent and over-hyped games like Halo 3, Smash Brothers Brawl, and [[Metal Gear Solid|Metal Gear Solid 4]]. He has also called out [[Tim Buckley]] on occasion (like anybody has not done that before) for his faggotry. [[V/]] has a love/hate relationship with him, and the board will often be split if he reviews a game they like (or used to like after watching his review on it because they can be easily lead).	
	
Yahtzee's latest venture is a car crash of a TV pilot by the name of [http://www.gamedamage.net GameDamage].  A show that couldn't be more tragic than if it consisted of the Taliban flying [[Princess Diana]]'s funeral procession escorted by a bus full of blind orphans into the World Trade Center on 9/11.

'''Eric Tellah''' is a [[YouTube Nobodies|YouTube nobody]] who after viewing [[Failcyclopedia|Encyclopedia Dramatica]] for the [[Newfags|first time]], decided to make a series called [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do-ro1OHmUo "Reviewing a Reviewer"] which is META AS FUCK, but it's just a shittier version of [[Retsupurae]]. It is great to know there is someone on YouTube that can [[Leeching|tell it like it is]]. He said it best himself:

:<i> "I'm just a [[lazy|regular]] [[Online sex games|video game]] [[fat|fan]], here to [[Bullshit|provide insight]] on what it's like to be a [[aspie|real gamer]]. I am absolutely [[rage|sick of]] the billions of idiot reviewers who collectively push the general image of gaming back a few decades by showing the world we're apparently [[The Internet is serious business|nothing but brainless idiots]]. In my series [[review|"Reviewing A Reviewer"]] you'll see several [[LARP|Videogame]] (and who knows, perhaps [[TGWTG|other media)]] reviewers [[unfunny|get reviewed]] and you can [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LLQipN1-SE see for yourself] how bad they're all making us look.

:So pull up a [[chair]], and if you can deal with my limited [[ms paint]] skills and shit quality audio, let's [[Fuck|explore]] [[Orgy|the world]] of [[mirror|incompetent reviewers]] [[Masturbate|together]]."</i>

When he's not making shitty Retsupuraes or playing video games in his spare time, he also does [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3esi_ilTK4 voice acting] over [[Final Fantasy VII]] for voice auditions in [[fan dub]]s, so that he can hopefully one day get himself as much [[13-year-old boy|13-year-old]] [[ass]] as his voice acting idol, [[Vic Mignogna]].

In recent years, with the success of [[Unfunny|wonderful]] websites like [[TGWTG|ThatGuyWithTheGlasses]], it was [[Myth|inevitable]] that eventually everybody on YouTube would become an angry reviewer, and for '''Joel Holmes''' it was more than a good enough reason to get started in angry reviewing. He decided to call his character "The Bastard Gamer", which is at least [[Not_really|semi-original]] considering the amount of "That Blanks With The Blanks" in the world. His modus operani is to review [[Cheap|bargain bin]] video games from [[GameStop]] and other shit he had laying around his [[Basement-dweller|mancave]]. He was eventually recruited by FreezeCracker.com, the home of [[Video Game Reviewers#Geoff Mendicino .2F FreezeCrackerFun|Geoff Mendicino]] and [[Gamelife]], which did wonders for his [[USI|already-inflated ego]].

Because he was getting called out on his [[Defeat|'success']], he became an [[anti-troll]] within the YouTube community, so he could take a stand against [[YouTube Commentaries#METOKUR|a channel he deemed a threat to his ego]]. He has decided to play [[YouTube Commentaries|The Commentary Game]] with his buddy above, [[Video Game Reviewers#Asalieri|Asalieri]], and make [[Unfunny|enjoyable]] [[Satire|parody videos]] of even more successful YouTubers like [[Irate Gamer]] and [[Alexander4488]]. Even though trolling these people have already been [[3Guys1Hammer|beaten to death with a hammer]], [[Holocaust|sent to Auschwitz, cremated in a gigantic oven]], and then sent to [[Haiti]] as a form of toilet paper - they still continue to do it anyway. Currently, he has no fucking clue if he wants to be an angry reviewer who wants [[Pathetic|fellatio from the female cast of Street Fighter]], or if he wants to be a parody of angry reviewers who wants [[Pathetic|fellatio from the female cast of Street Fighter]].

A total fucking piece of shit, it changes account names often after being <s>banned</s> reborn time and again. On reviews it often booms its eardrum destroying voice into the mic at what seems like impossible decibels. It often tries to ride the coattails of other cock smokes like lukemorse1, MagusX1, and Bibleteen. Sometimes it will present reviews in [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Dave_in_drag.jpg  drag], which makes pinpointing the creatures exact sexuality impossible without hands on scientific research in a lab.

The claim of crimes committed against it appear to be endless.

Moar recently, Dave (in true [[SilentRob]] and [[Chris-chan]] fashion) has decided to edit this ED article with over 70 edits so far (check out the history tab) either BAAAALLETING it totally, or finally figuring it out that any EDiot can revert his edits with just one click,  deciding to replace his title pic with his own self-approved [[Fat Girl Angle Shot|version to make him look slightly less of a whale]], alongside some girl in deep depression of being within the vicinity of young David.

Even moar recently, Dave, under his Agetnin account here, has managed to do a additional 50 something fucking edits to this page in less then 24 hours, adding and removing the entry above on jboypacman, among other things.

The show reached mini-[[meme]] levels when [http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/2006/03/another-bunch-of-complete-morons-have.html UK Resistance] discovered their [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa_evWCnblw pilot] for the internet series, (then called the even more retarded ''GamerWeb 2.0'') and [[lol|loled]] at the fact they couldn't spell "Eye" correctly and assumed having a sock reviewing video games in a high-pitched voice was a [[retarded|good idea]].

'''Dan Rizzo''', a former game reviewer from [[Australia]] that reviewed crappy games and crappy movies about his homeland, who can't keep his mouth shut for five seconds unless he's spewing some sort of total [[bullshit]] from his fat wallaby fucking ass.

This [[fat]] <s>[[KFC]] eating</s> black person reviews games in the same style as [[Spax3]], but with more aids and fail. At least this [[faggot]] never sues people and talks about phone sex. He's also does let's plays and walkthroughs because this fat fuck has no life whatsoever.  He's also a anime [[weeaboo]] who jacks off to <s>Tea Gardner from [[yugioh|Yu-Gi-Oh]]</s> Babs Bunny from Tiny Toons.

[[Image:Thechristg53engrish.PNG|thumb|left|A VIB hater who has spelling worse than VIB himself]]

A basic-level [[troll]] who used the once-lambasted work of a [[fat]] [[child|12-year-old]] [[asspie]] to mimic [[Chadwardenn]], thus duping the easily-trolled video game reviewer community on YouTube. 

He rose to unexpected fame and infamy after [[Armake21]] bashed his "review" of Contra. As thousands watched this video, it spawned a frenzy of [[lulz]] not seen since the aforementioned Chadwardenn, as it took a fraction of the video game community months to figure out he merely reuploaded someone else's work. Even today, most people will still say that Sizzler's work is [[Bullshit|authentic]]. With his purpose served, Sizzler07 closed his account, serving the lulz with minimal effort, but with great honor.

===[[Insane|Undercoverfilmer00v]]===
[[Image:Undercoverfilmer.jpg|thumb|left|Undercoverfilmer00v]]

Skyscraper-high egotistical and [[batshit insane]] YouTube reviewer who was best known for reviewing games [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|with a paper bag over his head]] and released [[lie|epic]] [[TL;DW|45-minute reviews]] [[redundant|analyzing every aspect of the game]]. He [[ITT Tech|went to film school]], so he fancied himself far superior than any other reviewer out there, even the [[Video Game Reviewers#The Angry Video Game Nerd|AVGN]]. He was so egotistical that he compared his reviews to [[unwarranted self-importance|"works of film"]]. He also released a series of level run-throughs showing his gaming skill [[shit nobody cares about|playing Goldeneye with no weapons on 007 mode]].

After a lulzless [[Flame War|e-war]] with [[Video Game Reviewers#AkewsticRockR|AkewsticRockR]], the Undercoverfilmer put his page on [[delete fucking everything|lockdown]] and hasn't released anything since, constantly bashing his fanbase in the process.
