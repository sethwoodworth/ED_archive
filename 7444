Sheep
<i>If you are looking for people who mindlessly conform, see [[Mundanes]].</i>


Sheep (''Ovis aries'') are commonly found in [[New Zealand]] and [[Wales]]. Sheep also constitute the entire population of [[Wyoming]], half of [[Montana]], and small cults throughout [[Ohio]]. When sheep and humans mingle, [[sex]] frequently occurs because sheep are slutty and seldom say no.

Some people are not entirely satisfied with vanilla sheep sex and prefer to spice up their love lives with a bit of kink. Exotic human/sheep sexual practices include [[bondage]] and even the wearing of [[fursuit]]s during [[sex|copulation]]. [[Image:Sheep.jpg|thumb|[[BDSM]] Sheep]]

 Hoof cuffs and shearings and six teat bikinis,
 Shiny Chrome cages to lock on your weenies,
 fetish and beasties and 6 nipple rings,

== All Alone And Feeling Ewe ==
Rarely, sheep-fuckers are rejected by their ewes and must turn to artificial aids. Fortunately, the [[internet]]s is there to fulfill their needs.

== Seeking Help ==
Occasionally, a sheep-lover will have a moment's doubt about the sanity of his [[fetish]]. In that troubled time, [[forum]]s or animal [[communities]] are the best places to find informed, [[sensitive]] counseling.

== Voters ==

Voters are often referred to as sheep because they are furry, stupid, and prone to running off cliffs because the other sheep did it. A Google search for "voters+sheep" indicates this insult is used in [[over 9000]]% of political conversations.

=="Sheep" as Described by the Batshit [[Insane]] ==
The term sheep is applied by members of many of the crazier internet communities to describe [[mundane|normal people]]. They refer to the non-insane as sheep or sheeple because these communities are conformist masses who all think the same way, blindly follow their community leaders without question, and are threatened by anyone who doesn't live like they do. For this reason those who don't agree with them are referred to as sheep.

Supporters or creators of [[conspiracy]] theories are notorious for applying this title to fucking anyone, including skeptics, believers of other conspiracy theories, or anyone who asks questions they don't have an answer to. If you don't believe that [[JEWS DID WTC]], you are a sheep.

== Jew Sheep == 

Many [[JEW|Jews]] are also sheep.

== Killer Sheep ==
Around the globe, rumors of killer sheep have been circulating. Be vigilant, be prepared.
