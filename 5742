[[Image:Barneybunchportalraid.jpg|frame|right|An orgy of the Jewgrounds sophisticate.]]
The Newgrounds Flash Portal is the access point to the site's archives of Flash movies and games. There are few places on the internets which blatantly condone such levels of stupidity as are encouraged here, at what is essentially Jewgrounds's "claim to fame," the point of origination of such timeless classics as [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/96604 AGNRYMAN ANTICS] (in which a clearly [[angry|irate]] fellow prances around an animated city, eventually stealing a [[dildo]] from a store and sodomizing himself), [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/420056 Freezepop's JEM] (in which a [[13 year old boy|13 year old]] Jewgrounds user gyrates seductively to a song by a group of [[homosexuals]], and the unforgettable [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/310349 Pico's School] (a late-nineties tribute to [[Columbine]], of rather dubious intentions).

Pico's School was one of the first cartoons showcased on the website, as it was created by [[Tom Fulp]] himself, when young Tom was a [[Newgrounds#The_Disturbed_Loner|Disturbed Loner]] in the days before Jewgrounds' popularity level was [[over 9000]]. In his angst-filled formative years, Tom espoused [[communist]] ideas -- much to the chagrin of his [[Nazi]] worshipping elder brother -- and believed in the ability of all people to have an equal amount of space in which to be as stupid as is possible. Thus, Tom was inspired to create (along with the existing [[Flash]] Portal) a Voting System and a Review System, in the ultimate trifecta of idiocy.

These days, though, the Flash Portal is a wholly different [[breast|beast]]. It is governed largely by Flash groups, such as the intellectually active [[Barney Bunch]], [[Lock Legion]] and [[Clock Crew]], who are likely to submit anywhere from [[at least 100]] to [[over 9000]] Flash animations on a daily basis, each one lowering the bar just a little bit more on the creativity scale. Each of these crews, of course, has a dedicated fanbase and even [http://www.clockcrew.cc legitimate websites] to coordinate their efforts through, often teaming up to produce steaming piles of excrement, unidentifiable as anything resembling entertainment.

Because of the large followings of these Flash groups, it was quickly ascertained by the leaders of the groups that it would behoove them and their inevitable descendants to establish their groups' reputations as [[circle jerk]]s of [[unfunny|unfunniness]]. Thus, they decreed that all members of their groups were, as a condition of membership, required to '''VOET FIEV''' and '''RAET TEN''' on all Flash movies and games submitted by members of their respective groups, no matter [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/332685 how bad the quality]. 

This was exacerbated by Tom Fulp's official recognition of an annual "Clock Day,"[http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2005][http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2006] [http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2007][http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/clockday2008] whereby hundreds of Flash "artists" submit hundreds of Flash "artworks" of terrible quality - all of them involving characters central to the "Clock Crew" cause, and all of them being easily saved from [[Newgrounds#.22Blammed.22|"blamming"]] by [[orgasm]]ing Clock Crew members, eager to proliferate their own shittiness, which has existed and been expanded significantly since the group's founding in 2001.

===Voting System===
[[Image:Voting_Range_NG.png|thumb|right|Don't be fooled! <small>0 and 5 are the only buttons that work!</small>]]
The ranking score of each Flash movie and game in the hierarchy of [[shit]], is determined by how highly [[user]]s rate it. There is a choice of two ratings a viewer can bestow upon Newgrounds movies: '''0''' and '''5'''. There are also buttons for 1, 2, 3 and 4 but one would have to be a [[faggot]] to actually deem a flash somewhere between perfect and total shit.

HINT: There are [[Newgrounds#How_to_get_.231_in_the_portal|many surefire ways]] to make the Jewgrounds public adore your effort as much as or EVEN MORE THAN an average Clock Crew or Barney Bunch submission, but none are more effective that these: an ideal way to inspire the masses to give [[you|your]] [[Flash]] effort a '''FIVE''' is to haphazardly throw in a bunch of stick figures killing and/or sodomizing each other over a [[Linkin Park|Papa Roach]] song, as well to include any or all of the words "[[Sonic]]," "Mega Man," "[[Penis]]" or "[[X]]" in the title. 

Alternatively, one could reupload the exact same animation [[42]] times and call it a "series". [http://afrounderscorestud.newgrounds.com/flash/ Ex.]

Flash reviews operate on a similar basis as the VOET FIEV system, except that scores can go up to 10 instead of 5. Once again, and this cannot be stressed enough, '''YOU SHOULD ONLY EVER GIVE A FLASH EITHER 0 OR 10.''' Doing anything else would be a waste of voting power and most likely get your review deleted.

You should also make certain you [[I can swear!|swear as much as you can]] and ''always'' proofread your review to ensure that it's spelled as poorly as humanly possible. Using all caps is also a guaranteed way to get noticed.

But every so often, a user will take it upon himself to crawl and claw his way beyond the humble expectations of stupidity that are a given when reviewing a piece of [[Flash]] on Jewgrounds. And if one was to see such a review as that, one would smile and think it a great leap forward for a website famous for great leaps backwards.

And then one would glance at the [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/28240/ flash that was under scrutiny,] and one would weep with sorrow for the reduction of all expectations to exactly the same point as when the whole ordeal had begun: Before one's tear-streaked face, a six-paragraph opus to the letter "B".

:*<big>'''The Infamous ''B'' Review'''</big> '''<span class="co;[-];[+];0;earfetish;default"></span> '''
<div class="earfetish" style="padding: 5px;">

{{quote|'''Absolutely brilliant.'''

<small><small>When looked upon by inexperienced critiques, one might wonder why such a work of art deserves a high score. But, if one looks in depth and with a high degree of intellectual insight, we can see exactly what makes this work brilliant. My interpretation of the piece, as follows, regarding the very structure and sustenance in which art like this thrives; will be -- I believe, revealing to those that fail to understand the beauty of the B.

The first thing that strikes me as I look upon the B is that one notices it is not quite to the centre of the canvas -- in fact, the B is maligned and off-kilter, slightly to the upper left of the centre of the piece. I believe that this was done on purpose to convey the underlying theme of the piece, that of chaos and unorthodoxy, that of irreverence and rebellion. The artist is trying to convey the message that our world is not perfect, that each one of the many peoples of this earth must work together for a humane, constructive effort to ensure the betterment of our civilization, and our future.

This theme is predominately reflected by the simple choice of colour for the B, that of a pure, mathematically perfect red. When viewing the piece, the average audience member might simply interpret red as fury, anguish, and aggression. But, due to the exact and calculated nature of the red used in this work, I offer that it portrays itself moreover as knowing and confident, acting out of will and intellect, not arrogance and bravado. This is where the genius of the artist comes out, that such as rebellious and vulgar colour can be seen as precise, and civilized.

As for the white background, one might interpret it as more of a clear, sterile, and forced utopia. I recall images of Huxley's and Zamyatin's nightmares as they reflect upon the background. It portrays the B, almost as a lone child wandering off into the wilderness, being pushed to perform inhumane tasks by his cruel masters. The emptiness and lack of conscience is contrasted by the will and soul of the B. A nightmare indeed, but one that haunts us all.

When we notice that the choice of the letter, B, out of all twenty-six in the English alphabet was chosen, we must wonder why. Before I get into that, let me offer some rationale and evidence from further examination of the B itself. When looking at the typeface, we immediately realise that it is of a serif font, most likely Times New Roman or Bookman Antiqua. We also notice that the B is a capital B, not a lowercase one. Thus, I suggest that this implies a struggle for power and control, over the most likely antagonist: A. Because of its Roman nature and status, we assume that the B is of a high-rank lieutenant in some corporate atmosphere, but has the desire and will to become the very best, to overthrow the A and in turn, become first. B does not settle for second place. B does not accept anything other than perfection. B is disgusted by the corruption and inability to function by A, and B plots to end the reign of the A. This is the horrible truth, the truth that all of us hold true. For yet, life is only a struggle for more and more power, control, and wealth.

This is but my interpretation. Yet, I would argue that many more would hold this opinion as well. Although close to perfection, I do not believe that this work deserves a perfect ten for a few reasons. Despite its succinct and flawless simplicity, it lacks of literary elements that give more power and gusto to the artist's voice. Though violins and cellos alike can perfect a string quartet, the clarinet is left in the dark, as its own timbre holds back its performance. Though this work is like the clarinet, struggling to match the power of the strings, it does come very, very close. Though, through wavering willpower and diminishing strength, it does not achieve the goal it set out to reach. But in effect, I bow to the beauty and elegance that enriches the entire performance, for it is this work of art that truly dominates the entire concert.</small></small>

====<big>The Teddy Review Spam War</big>====
Recently, a group of [[retards]] and [[fags]] emigrated from [[JewTube]] and began to spam the Newgrounds Flash review boards with the same tired [[copypasta]] review, over and over again:

{{quote|'''Hi, I am Teddy. Once you read this you cannot get out. Finish reading this until it is done! As I said, I am Teddy. I am 7 years old. I have no eyes and blood all over my face. I am dead. If you don't send this to at least 12 people I will come to your house at midnight and I'll hide under your bed. When you're asleep, I'll kill you. Don't believe me?|color=#3566A2|size=550%}}'''''

It goes on for [[over 9000]] paragraphs of [[spam]] before ending. These reviews should have been deleted, but Tom Fulp, being the Jew [[faggot]] wanna-be-black person he is, has not deleted any of these reviews(save for mine) and actually disabled his [[mods]] from doing [[shit]] about it until a few months after it started. Because of this, a bunch of [[fag]] users began freaking out about it, causing mass chaos on the portal and leading to [[Bigbadron]] killing a [[negro]]. As a result of seeing all this go down, ED is now asking you all to add to the super [[lulz]] by spamming the entire Teddy review (found at the flash links below) a couple billion times to piss off the [[meatspin]] lovers on Jewgrounds.

Look for the full "Teddy" review to copy and paste in your own malicious reviews of EVERY SINGLE FLASH in Jewgrounds [[history]] to piss the off the [[virgin]]s who have nothing else to do but read through Flash reviews on Jewgrounds all day.

Hi, I am Teddy. Once you read this you cannot get out. Finish reading this
until it is done! As I said, I am Teddy. I am 7 years old. I have no eyes
and blood all over my face. I am dead. If you don't send this to at least 12
people I will come to your house at midnight and I'll hide under your bed.
When you're asleep, I'll kill you.
Don't believe me?

*Case 1:
Patty Buckles
Got this e-mail. She doesn't believe in chain letters. Well, Foolish Patty.
She was sleeping when her TV started flickering on and off. Now she's not
with us anymore. Ha ha patty, Ha ha! You don't want to be like Patty, do
you?

*Case 2:
George M. Simon
Hates chain mail, but he didn't want to die that night. He sent it to 4
people. Not good enough George. Now, George is in a coma, we don't know if
he'll ever wake up. Ha ha George, Ha ha! Now, do you want to be like George?

*Case 3:
Valarie Tyler
She got this letter. Another chain letter she thought. Only had 7 people to
send to. Well, That night when she was having a shower she saw bloody Mary
in the mirror. It was the BIGGEST fright of her life. Valarie is scarred for
life.

*Case 4:
Derek Minse
This is the final case I'll tell you about. Well, Derek was a smart person.
He sent it to 12 people. Later that day, he found a $100.00 bill on the
ground. He was premoted to head officer at his job and his girlfriend said
yes to his purposal. Now, Katie and him are living happily ever after.The
have 2 beautiful children.

Send this to at least 12 people or you'll face the consequences.

'''0 people'''- You will die tonight

'''1-6 people'''- you will be injured

'''7-11 people'''- you will get the biggest fright of your life

'''12 and over'''- you are safe and will have good fortune!

Do What Teddy Says!!!! Hurry, you must send to 12 people before midnight
tonight</div></div>

SCARY WAY TO BREAK UP!!!!! DO NOT stop reading this or something bad will happen!!!!!!!! One day, Sarah was walking home from school when her boyfriend drove by and honked at her to get in. She got in his car and he drove her to the lake. Her boyfriend said he was going to tell her something very important. Sarah could have sworn he was going to propose. However, he flicked her off, pushed her in the lake and yelled, "I am breaking up with you, you awful ........!! I hate you and I think that maybe you should just end your .............. life! DUMB ............ ........!!!" He laughed and drove off. It was a very cold day. Sarah climbed out of the lake, freezing cold, and feeling the worst she had in her entire life. She got home went in a hot bath, and slit her wrists and died in the bathtub. Her parents yelled and screamed at her to get out until they finally broke the door down. They saw no body, but the entire bathroom was dripping with her blood. Her mom went insane and killed herself three days later, her dad is in prison, accused of murder. Later that week, Sarah's exboyfriend was taking a shower when she came from the drain, rotting and bloody, with a razor in her hand and said "Goodbye Jason." She cut his throat before he could scream. If you do not repost this, you are a heartless ..............and Sarah come to you in the shower from the drain, and will kill you the same way she killed her boyfriend. 24 ppl have failed to send and died Repost this to over 15 games '''You have 13 minutes close'''.</div></div>

Although the majority of the content on the Flash Portal is well below the standard for mental retardation, not every piece of shit makes into the Portal, as several submissions are relegated to the "Obituary" or "Graveyard" section of Jewgrounds on a daily basis.

=== How to get to "#1 All Time" on the portal === 
[[Image:NewgroundsFirst.jpg|frame|right|The Coveted Spot.]]
The #1 slot in the portal was [[at least 100 years ago|at one time]] a prestigious award. Now it's just a spot held by [[shit|video game parody]] Flashes five-bombed by [[13-year-old boy]]s. To achieve this esteemed position though Flash Cartoon creation, the following steps must be followed to the letter:

#First and most important of all, the animator must make plentiful use of dick jokes, in order to compensate for viewer virginity. 
#Equally important to step one, one must collect a series of tired images from '70s [[porn]]os, and place them ''artfully'' together to produce a hardcore [[porn]] slideshow that may or may not include child rape and likely spawns pop-ups. Also, one mustn't forget to co-author some well-known animators, to lend an undeserved sense of legitimacy to your [[shit]]heap.
#One must also ensure that all female characters of the animation contribute copious amounts of [[fanservice]] and have no personality.
#Also integral to catching prepubescent attention spans is the use of colorful expletives (that would include, but would not be limited to ''shit, cunt, dick, fuck, ass, arse ([[Britain|Britfags!]]), twat, wank'' etc.). In this way, the plentiful [[13 year old boys]] will believe that the animator's flash, and by extension of that, the animator, is [[hardcore]]. These sheep will later become invaluable to one's efforts in [[Clock Crew|conquering the Portal]].
#One must also make [[obvious|clever]] and [[unfunny|hilarious]] observations about popular video games, upon which the Jewgrounds populous draws Life Force. (i.e. What's up with that Mario Guy, and why does he enjoy diving into tight, steamy holes filled with excrement?)
#[http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/437489 It would also behoove one to make an overt reference] to the [[Clock Crew]], [[Kitty Krew]], Lock Legion, Uzi Union, Glock Group, [[Barney Bunch]], or any number of these dedicated, alliterative groups.
#Using [[emo]]-,[[Linkin Park]]-, or [[Heavy Metal|Failure]]-brands of music in one's animation can never be overestimated in terms of importance. In fact, to ensure universal appeal, why not use all three in the ultimate brooding [[teenager]] trifecta?
#In order to generate nostalgic sentiment amongst the elder teenagers, who would understand such references, throwing in an entire [[Matrix]] bullet-time sequence, or any thing related to the Matrix is likely to cause instant first-place status.
#Submissions using sprites from video games that were popular [[at least 100]] years ago, most notably [[Mario]] or [[Phoenix Wright]], have a great deal of potential for finding success, regardless of quality.
#To make all characters in one's animation burst out into [[Tenacious D]] anthems at cadenced intervals, and to quote [[South Park]] whenever possible is a directive which cannot be stressed enough for the serious exploiters.
#One must also make sure to [[Mind of Mencia|steal]] [[unfunny]] jokes from [[YTMND|unfunny sites]] and/or [[The Simpsons|moldy sitcoms]].
#Throwing in a [[Randy Solem|fart joke]] for good measure can never hurt your chances. Every Jewgrounder intrinsically loves a fart joke. Ha. Ha.
#If possible, one should avoid using any English, at all. Instead, it is prudent to use the [[Engrish|language]] embraced by the vast majority of Newgrounders.
#Finally, before one submits a ''masterwork,'' it should be made certain that everything looks very "cute," in order that closet-[[homosexual]] viewers permeating the Portal can better relate to the work.
