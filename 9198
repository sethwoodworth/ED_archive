'''X people Y''' is an attention seeking meme used by the fat, despicable, penisheads of YouTube, which is why you have probably used this meme. It is most commonly seen on music videos and live performances of widely-accepted-to-be shitty bands with adamant followers.  Such videos are usually [[troll|trolled]] by [[anon]] who make the fanboys cry.  In an attempt to save [[creed|their musical tastes]] from complete and utter castration by exposure, the fanboys will try to label every dislike on the video as a matter of personal [[opinion]], or made by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.  In reality, everyone who disliked the shitty video couldn't be fucked to go back and see what some [[butthurt]] youtube faggot said about them, so the comment is hugely thumbed up by every other member of the fanboy [[hivemind]].

==Who?==
The people who do ''X people Y'' are usually the lowest form of [[basement dweller]].  They have had no exposure to [[Unified Diversity|diversity]] and therefore label any form of [[Pop music|popular music]] or [[Twilight|film with teen appeal]] as good.  As everyone knows, [[the internet is serious business]] and most [[nobody|people who aren't basement dwellers]] don't have time to put every stupid person in their place.  The result of this is usually [[basement dwellers]] making a big deal out of their interests and the rest of the world being too [[Fapping|busy]] to justify why their interests are complete and utter [[garbage]].

==Why?==
Most of the time, ''X people Y'' is done because the [[You|person]] is feeling unusually oppressed for their [[Unrealistic Expectations|untrue opinions]].  They need something to raise their [[ego]] and having seen everyone else getting massive numbers of thumbs ups for an ''X people Y'' comment, [[Fail|try it themselves]]. More often than not, though, they are simply seeking to have their comment thumbed up by other like minded individuals, thus proving that this method is only utilized by those with an advanced case of [[USI|USI]].
