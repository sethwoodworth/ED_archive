Drama
{{disambig}}
[[Image:Drama.jpg|thumb|Oh! Yes, the drama, we know, we know.]]

Prior to the term being ''looted'' by [[Faggots|the gays]] to describe their petty little [[cat fight]]s, [[drama]] was considered a genre of literature intended for the [[theater]]. It was later ''found'' by users of [[teh]] [[Internets]] to describe their violent and humiliating fights. Since then, [[drama]] has come to mean any [[rape|incident]], scene, gaffe, rumor, opinion or disagreement that is blown entirely out of proportion. [[IRL]] drama almost always starts with [[infidelity]] and ends with [[lulz]]. Drama is best left for [[yo momma]].

Drama results when matters are made into a bigger deal than need be, and it is used to draw and keep much-wanted [[attention]], but it waters down everything to a degree where no one actually cares. Most people will often declare they hate drama, but they are usually lying â€” because, honestly, why else would reality [[television]] be so popular?

Drama is the oh-so-important ingredient to a good article on this lovely site of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] (hence the name). Any article that does not contain [[at least 100|sufficient amounts]] of drama worth recording will probably have <b><nowiki>{{baleetplz}}</nowiki></b> or <b><nowiki>{{deathnotice}}</nowiki></b> slapped on the page, to indicate that it should be [[pwn]]ed by ED's [[sysop]]s, if they have not done so already.
