Ajsiu is the world's leading developer of [[HTML]] and CSS. He invented HTML himself, and when he got bored of that, he invented CSS. One can only marvel how he has made such a beautiful and large site.

Little is known about Ajsiu, but it is known that he is teaching web design at one of the Ivy League colleges. His site has been up since 1995 and his expansive [http://www.geocities.com/ajsiu/page2.html joke section] has been getting [[lulz]] for years. Many have claimed to have read every joke in his archive, but these people are widely regarded as bluffing.

Visiting his site WILL make you [[gay|happy]]. Please refer to diagram on right.

His site has long been draining the bandwidth of [[geocities]] with his millions of page views hourly. The servers needed to run his site can fill two Empire State Buildings. If you are female, it is recommended to send nude pics of yourself.
