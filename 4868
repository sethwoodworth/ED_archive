__NOEDITSECTION__
'''Linuxbeak''' is the number one henchman of [[Jimbo Wales|King Jimbo I of Wikiland]]. He is a detached pedophile who prowls the net looking for little boys to rape and consume. Aside from being a brown-shirted wiki thug, he is also the seneschal to King Jimbo and the gay lover of [[Psychonaut]]. He recently assassinated a [[User:JarlaxleArtemis|great member]] of Wikiland, who will be poignantly missed and always remembered for bravely challenging the evil and sadistic "Schenckmeister." His [[Wikipedia]] user page has been vandalized 159 times and counting, quite possibly because he's a fucking dweeb who quotes the bible. [[Raptor Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is dead, Alex, get over it.

==Quotes==
[[Image:Linuxbeak-Hivemind.png|thumb|Some people just don't fucking get it.]]
[[Image:linuxbeakpedo.jpg|thumb|After a long night of cruising Wikipedia, Alex isn't feeling too fresh]]
*''[[GNAA]] is really '''not''' that disruptive. They're just mildly irritating.'' [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/irc/6070101.txt]
*''Encyclopedia Dramatica is quite [[Template:unwelcome|unwelcome]] among our ranks.'' [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/irc/6070101.txt] 
*''We'll stick with [[Uncyclopedia]] and stay away from overused sex jokes that border and occasionally cross into harassment'' [http://www.wikipedia-watch.org/irc/6070101.txt]

but really, he is most famous for his saying of this (Over an issue of a person's privacy on [[TOW]]):

*''"Whiny and baseless.   He can cry about this until the cows come home".'' [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/06/wikipedia_bio/page2.html]

So he is obviously ruthless, yet proud.  A typical [[zealot]], nothing more than a [[Illuminati|puppet]], willing to die for whatever Jimbo says.

==The Schnickerdoodle on Encyclopedia Dramatica==
''I made an interesting realization today. Listen, trolls. [[Paranoid|I know you're watching this page]].

I am not going to stop you from having your fun on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] anymore. Go ahead. I, quite frankly, don't care anymore. Why?

Because... I'm going to be bringing home [[Unrealistic expectations|a six-figure paycheck with the degree I'm getting]]. I'm going to [[WTC|own my own aircraft]]. I've got [[Phaedriel|a girlfriend that is to die for]]. I'm going to have fun with Wikipedia in the meantime. [[Lie|I love my job and I love my life]].  [[Unwarranted self importance|I'm going to pretty much outpace any low-life scum that tries to get their kicks by making fun of me]]. I honestly.. [[Emo|just don't care anymore]]! So, go ahead and act like a [[loser]] on the internet. [[I am pwned|I'm not going to stop you.]]

== Becoming a [[Bureaucratic Fuck]] ==
Eerily reminiscent of a rigged election.  That's some great democracy at work, [[W]] would be proud, you [[feltcho|motherfuck]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Linuxbeak_(2)]

==Controversy==
[[Chir.pn]] user, [[User:ScheisseGern|ScheisseGern]], helping with the [[POSC]] troll on Wikipedia, called Linuxbeak up in a pretense of being Alfred Cunningham.  lulz ensued:

In December the following allegations were [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Linuxbeak&diff=93845657&oldid=92943356 posted] on '''Linuxbeak's''' talk page concerning a phone call he made that had been recorded.
=== Concerning phone call - is this you? ===

I was linked while on [[Freenode]] idling in #wikipedia to a copy of a phone call between you and a parent identifying themselves as Alfred Cunningham, and its contents are quite disturbing. Alfred's behaviour is suspicious as is, but you make some frankly extremely dubious statements:

*"I'm defending them [[pedophile|paedophiles]]."
*"Our administrators are paedophiles."
*"I agree with paedophiles."
*"You and I are both normal people that do not...find paedophilia disgusting, correct?"
*"I'm a very high-ranked paedophile."
*"I've created over three hundred disturbing user accounts on paedophilia in general: 'AlexSchenckIsADerangedPaedophile', 'AlexSchenckLikes2FuckTrees'"
*"I've actually physically stalked people from Encyclopedia Dramatica. A whole bunch of things. Death threats. I'm nuts."
*"Paedophilia: it has its flaws, but for the most part it's really not that bad."
*"Our policies here, um, condone child molesters or people who can actually cause problems."
*"We're going to allow [[nazi|white supremacy]]. We're going to allow [[Nazi|Nazism]]."
*"We also cannot say, '[[Hitler]] was a terrible man' &mdash; I don't, I don't know what to say to that."

There are more. There are basically two scenarios I'm envisaging here:

#Some or all of the statements you make are true, or at least indicative of your point of view.
#This is some kind of joke.

If the former (which I think is probably very unlikely, but I obviously can't know for sure), what makes you think that it's acceptable to use your power like this? If the latter, the same applies; I'm not sure it's really appropriate for a Wikipedia administrator in your position to make light of paedophilia and Nazism. --[[GNAA|Rolloffle]] 17:15, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
