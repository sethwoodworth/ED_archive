DWG
'''Digimon World Gaia''' is a [[cult|guild]] on [[Gaia Online]] about none other than ''[[Digimon]]''. It is entirely comprised of [[basement-dwelling]] [[furries]], [[you|social outcasts]], [[fat|morbidly-obese]] people and [[Daxflame|borderline-autistic]] [[fantards]] who carry around a [[LOL WUT|1st edition V-pet]] like it's the [[Bible]]. [[Troll]] at your own risk.

[[Image:wtfisthisshit.jpg|thumb|A common reaction to the faggotry of DWG.]]

In this cesspool of [[furfaggotry]], you get to [[BDSM|tame]] your own [[Digimon]] and make it [[Steroids|stronger]]! You can also post on the [[circlejerk|forums]] about [[fail|in-depth]] topics such as "[[George Lucas|how i get lightsabers?]]" and "[[BAWWWWW|THIS PLACE IS NO FAIR!!1]]". Not to mention that you can cock-fight your [[Digimon]] against others for no reason at all. [[Neopets|Sound familiar?]] 

The sad part is that the [[L. Ron Hubbard|leader]] of this [[circlejerk]] [[Scientology|cult]] claims that the concept of their guild is [[original content|completely original]], [[lulz|when really they just ripped it off from another faggy ''Digimon'' guild who weren't even original in the first place.]]

== The Rules of DWG ==
DWG is a Gaia Online guild who trys to [[buttsecks|please]] all of their members. [[Lie|DWG gives all their art, and everything else in their guild, free.]]

*Follow the Gaian TOS or else we'll get true mods to [[Lulz|banhammer ya to Albuquerque]].

*Respect your fellow [[Faggots|guild members]], your [[Retards|loyal crew]], and your [[Furry|Captain]] and [[Black|Vice Captain]], and vice versa.

*[[Do it faggot|Don't harass people in our name or at all]]. (Though this is both common sense and part of the Gaian TOS, we found it'd be good to remind you kind folks of the guild.)

DWG was created when Digimon Tamer Island failed at a guild. [[Lie|DWG is an awesome guild, where everything is free, unlike Tamer Island]].
