=Kytalise: Homosexual Narutard Extraordinaire=
Kytalise is yet another [[sheezyart|shittyart]] user who is made of an almost pure 1:1 ratio of [[fail|fail]] to [[aids|aids]]. This shining example of a sheezyart shitlet was first spotted on the [[crap|frontpage]], where the [[shit|artworks]] with the most favorable votes at that point in time are displayed. This would leave many asking the question of "Why exactly was he on the front page?" 
[[Image:Kytalise_WTF_Doll.PNG|thumb|left|WTF! These are the creepy things it [[rapes|plays]] with.]]

Well, the piece in question was actually a story about [[buttsecks|gay love]] between the popular anime characters [[Naruto]] and Sasuke. Many shitlets then proceeded to [[circlejerk|vote the piece up]] feverishly until it reached frontpage status, until it was equally [[KILL_IT_WITH_FIRE|saged into oblivion]] by all those who were [[Shocked_and_Appalled|shocked and appauled]] by the [[goatse|piece]].

It all started when a marginally acceptable [[emo|writer]] gave an in-depth [[drama|critique]] on the piece. This was taken as a [[flame|flame]] and prompted the current [[Flame_wars|shitstorm]] involving said user.
==Kytalise Shits a Brick==
[[Image:NaruFagFanFic.JPG|thumb|right|THE GOGGLES, THEY DO NOTHING!]]
Like any good [[lolcow]], Kytalise [[retarded|failed to comprehend]] the golden rule for all of his kind: [[rape|Do not feed the trolls]].
In doing such, he decided to [[asking_for_it|stand up for himself]] by writing quite a lengthy <s>piece of [http://www.sheezyart.com/journal/342505/ toilet paper] in his defence.</s>(LOL. "Journal not found".) This, however, was a thinly veiled attempt at gaining [[circlejerk|sympathy and/or pageviews]] from his fellow [[fag|narutards]]

==The Cry to the Mods for Support==

Keeping in trend with many other notable [[Rose Byrd|shitlet lolcows]], Kytalise decided to [[masturbate|abuse]] the comment-deleting system in an effort to [[lie|make himself look better]] than those who had trolled him. However, in true shitlet style, he failed to realise that deleting comments would only lead to his own [[an_hero|demise]], as he was deleting evidence of trolling at the same time. As such, Kytalise was entirely [[raped|without help]] from the mods. "What to now?" he asks himself. In a last, desperate attempt at saving his own ass, Kytalise screenshotted various [[faggotry|comment trees]] and submitted them to the sheezyart moderators in the hopes that something would be done. Nothing was done however, due to the mods just not [[Free_Speech|giving a shit]].

==Kytalise Deletes Fucking Everything==
After being excessively trolled, the [[narufag|Kytalise]] finally began to wave the white flag of defeat. However, in a [[lulz|lulzy]] flight of [[Insane|frenzy]], he began to [[Delete_fucking_everything|delete fucking everything]] that had anything to remotely do with the trolls - he even went so far as to [[an_hero|remove the comments portion of his userpage]]. To follow up, he decided to post a [[cry|journal]] explaining what happened. This journal was almost instantly [[raped|vandalized]], which led to the deletion of any and all journals. Not to be stopped, the [[trolls]] marched on, continuing to decimate the comments section of his artworks. He disabled comments on all of his artwork, except for the initial offending piece, which only served to make the trolls' penises harder.
[[Image:Kytalise_Fag_Friendp.PNG|thumb|right|An example of Kytalise's [[faggots|friends.]]]]

After the heat cooled down, Kytalise peaked out from his [[hugbox|hole]] and, much like an infant infront of [[ohbutyouwillpet|John Dallas Lockehart]], claimed he had [[asking_for_it|won]].

==Kytalise is an art thief==
Kytalise's ass patting watchers started complaining to the Trolls about false accusations of art thievery. When [[truth|facts]] were stated, the ass patters were too dull to realize that Kytalise steals art. Soon the proof the ass patters wanted was found. All of the stolen pictures. Kytalise tried pathetically to hide his/her (no one seems to know [[shemale|it's]] real gender. Funny.) gallery which is ultimately fail. Here are the links of the stolen art:
*This piece was titled Know Me, here is the link she stole it from.
http://yotsuba.saiin.net/~rough/kikaku/n-itoshi.html
*This piece was titled "Kiss Me" and here is the link she stole it from.

Upon noticing this, [[faggot]] it self came to revert the whole article into something that promotes him. This was immediately reverted back to normal where Kytalise realized it was beaten again. In attempt to cover things up, it deleted it's whole [[shit|gallery]].

==[[butthurt|Leaving]] SA forever==
After much Trolling, justice being served, and truth being told, it had enough. [[emo|Kytalise]] cried and ran away. After it realized it was defeated, Kytalise made it's last stand of [[faggotry]]. He deleted all of the stolen work from his gallery, hoping the shittyart mods wouldn't see the stolen art. With this he left shittyart is so called final farewell message. 

{{quote|I'm leaving b/c I don't have time for this shit right now.

If any of my watchers would like to read Save Me updates, go look for them on AFF. I'll put up the link later.

I'm sick of stupid fucking losers accusing me of stealing and idiots who find it funny to hurt me and my friends.

So I'm leaving here and am going to continue my schooling and life.|}}

Very butthurt he was.
===Leaving SA forever take 2===
Later on he had edited his profile, to this:
 
[[Image:Kytalise_Leaving_2.PNG|Leaving take 2]]

Look familiar? This shows how much of a life Kytalise really has.

==The return of Kytalise==
Soon after the little "leaving forever" sissy fight, it returned. It returned with this load of [[crap]], [http://www.sheezyart.com/journal/346069/ Journal of Thievery]. Little did it know, it was feeding the Trolls moar. Immediately it's [[stupid]] watchers [[I came|came]] and [[blow|sucked]] up to it right away. So the [[narufag]] continued with it's little story of how it [[lie|owns]] the site. We all can see this because it's in Japanese, and a company called OFP that she works with, right??? Oh wait, edit time! After the [[truth]] was stated yet again, it edited the journal and said it has a username on there. Right. In it's latest journal, Kytalise admits that it is an art thief, in a way that makes it look like he [[idiot|doesn't know]], AKA he is just a plain [[fucktard]].

In due time the comments that were "rude" were deleted. Kytalise really [[rapes|loves]] that [[crap|delete]] function! Soon it was found that one of the Narufags loyal ass patters, [[unfunny|Illusion007]] [http://www.sheezyart.com/journal/346413/ posted a journal] titled [[fail|security risk]]. Obviously he is one of the idiots who thinks by signing up to ED, and [[vandalizing|editing]] articles is [[hacking]]. The narufag contributed to this by [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Image:Kytalise_Gonna_Take_Over_ED.PNG/ making a devious plan to take ED over]. This lolcow was milked by many people. Yet another person who contributed to this editing was [[ugly|Soarhamaji]]. We suggest when scrolling on the users shittyart page, and come across her pictures, you cover your eyes. The goggles do nothing.

==The leave and return of Kytalise...again==
After [[Narufag|it]] has [[fail|lost]] once again a fight against [[Anonymous|Anon]], [[Narufag|Kytalise]] decided once again to leave [[Sheezyart|Shittyart]].
But, we all know [[Shemale|Kytalise]] being an [[Attention_whore|Attention whore]], [[Shemale|It]] continues on writing  [[Journals|Journals]] and replys to every [[attention|comment]].

==Happy Birthday, Kytalise==
August the 31. Kytalise's Birthday.
And what's a good Birthdaypresent? Right! To show [[shemale|it]] an DevianTART-Account with [[shemale|it's]] so-beloved [[shit|Fan-Fucks]].
Of course, Kytalise freak'd completely out and wrote another Journal of [[fail|fail]], asking it's Ass-Kisser to [[shit|report]]
Every single [[fail|Fan-Fuck]].

==The Kytalise Conspiracy==
One of the [[epic|epicest]] Theorys has been created by a [[sheezyart|Shittyart]]user named [http://shaddowkarate.sheezyart.com/ ShaddowKarate].
After [[emo|Kytalise]] has been confronted with an [[epic|epic]] but also [[lie|as it seemed to be untrue]] Theory, [[shemale|it]] stole also the Fanfictions, [[attention_whore|It]] has decided once moar, to delete fucking everything.
[[shit|This]] made quite a few people suspicous, which caused [[Hitler|Kytalise]] giving her [[emo|friends]] [[sex|felatios]] and lots of asskisses.
[[Image:Conspiracy.png|thumb|right|Somekind of a Theory]] It is somekind of a [[stupid|creative]] try, to see how [[stalin|Kytalise]] [[orgy|reacts]] or [[crybaby|deletes]].

==Kytalise calls out the [[Jihad|Jihad]]==
On August the 31st 2007, [[Shemale|Kytalise]] has called out a [[Jihad|Jihad]] against [[Anonymous|Anon]] and people that are claiming the [[truth|truth]].
This was posted on Kytalise's Journal but has been removed withing the next 5 minutes, due to Kytalise being a [[cockmongler|cockmongler]]

==Why YOU Should Troll Him==
Because there are many more [[lulz]] that have yet to be milked from this proverbial lolcow. His tendency to delete fucking everything leaves many possibilities for attempted [[cum|comebacks]] and secondary [[rape|lols]].
There are also some other [[fucktards]] who you can troll, provided in the [http://www.encyclopediadramtica.com/Kytalise#Links/ links] section.
