Mere Doyle
{{lollercoaster}}

'''Meredith Doyle''' is a 24-year-old [[otaku]], which is another word for [[anime]] [[faggot|freak]]. This is the epic tale of a girl with [[dreams|deams]] so big that it could not be contained on the internet. Too big even for an [[Girugamesh|anime convention]]; no she had to show her love for [[Japan|GLORIOUS NIPPON]] on national television: [[American Idol]].

== Mere Versus [[ಠ_ಠ|The Face of Evil]] ==
After the [[Dragon Ball Z|14-year training arc]] was completed, Mere believed that she was ready for the [[2girls1cup|spotlight]], but her dreams of being a [[J-Pop|kawaii singer]] in Japan were crushed by the Sinatra/Evangelion-loving Simon Cowell. But that was just the beginning, little did she realize that [[/a/]] was watching her, and were they pissed. In less than two hours, Mere's true power level was discovered in her [[Facebook|Facebook account]], [[Myspace|Myspace page]], [[Youtube|Youtube channel]], and [[deviantart|deviantart page]].

=== Cast of Characters ===
*'''Mere Doyle''': A girl on a 14-year journey to be the very best singer [[Pokemon|like no one ever was]].
*'''Simon Cowell''': A judge on [[American Idol]]. His dream is to fly to the moon, but he can't. Actually, he can.
*'''Randy Jackson''': A black guy. He suggests that Mere do the [[anime]] thing. [[ROFL|But she's not an animator, Randy!]]
*'''XxLetTheRainFallxX''': [[White Knight|First to defend Mere]] on deviantART. Made the bad decision to be the first to feel /a/'s wrath.
*'''Varsoon''': Claims to be [[AOL|internets-literate]] and know a lot about this [[CP|4chan stuff]]. [[Newfag|Apparently, not enough to get the hell out of the way and let Anon do what it wants.]] But he only defends her because he wants some of that sweet [[Dat ass|cosplayin'-ass]].
*'''Mere's Mom''': Daughter.... [[I am disappoint]].
*'''LookOfDisapproval''': [[ಠ_ಠ]]


== MereSpace ==

After being raided by /a/ all over the Interwebz, it had been presumed that Mere-chan became [[an hero|an hero]]. Turns out, the bitch is still alive and she is still making her [[fail|beauitful]] clothing. 
Not only has she made a new deviantArt page, but she has also reappeared on CosplayLab and [[Gaia Online|Gaia]]. She calls her new store 'MereSpace' and is offering 'advanced commissions', since she is obviously the best seamstress ever.
