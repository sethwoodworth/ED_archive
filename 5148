'''Malaysia''' is a South East Asian tourist trap inhabited by a species of [[Shit|humans]] called Malays followed by [[China|chinks]] and [[India|Indians]]. The immediate neighbor of Malaysia is [[Singapore]], which Malaysians hate because of the better system of government and the longer age expectancy the Singaporeans enjoy (and also how fckg rich they are), which just means that Singapore is shit better than them. They claim to be an Islamic nation, but really, most of them act like Jews and they still they call themselves true Muslims.

They also have advanced weapon called "Green laser" and successfully rape Vietnam & Indonesia. 
Indogs lost 3 - 0 and the first leg and win 2 - 1 at the second leg in the football AFF Suzuki Yamaha Honda Misubishi Cup.
But indogs still lose 4-2 according to the stupid aggregate points.
Well, the Harimau Transexual beat Garuda that night after winning at the GBK.


==History==
The land was called Malya at first, when the [[British|teacuppers]] had nothing else better to do but to [[rape]] the poor people there by bringing in the [[China|chinks]] and [[India|Indians]]as slaves to rape Malaya for them. But somehow after all those years of getting raped by the British and [[4chan|Japanese]], some tard finally found a way to free themselves by going to London to claim fake freedom around 1957, and they actually got what they wanted. That easy? Yep. But they're don't realized that, british still take over the goverment of malay-sial or whatever it is called until now

Some retards, should've done that bullshit couple years before... 

Now it's called Malaysia. Most people think that it's a cross between Malaya and Asia, and so it becomes Malaysial. Which is totally unoriginal, but everything in Malaysia is unoriginal and that's a fact.

==Language and Culture==
[[Image:2114986947 af6225aa52.jpg|thumb|What Malaysians wish they could look like ]]
The official language of Malaysia is Malay, which basically consists of sounds created by putting the tip of the tongue on the roof of the mouth just behind the teeth and moving it backwards, unlike the French language that will make anyone who tries to speak it die from a brain jam. Go ask a [[linguist]] to do a French tongue twister and see for yourself. 

However, in recent years, the Government realized that this inferior language has resulted in many instances mass miscommunication, sounding like retards and thus started the rapid introduction on English into the country. The Malaysians today mostly speak a modified, unperceivable form of English. The Chinese Maraysians? What erse? They speak [[Engrish]]. Mostry spoken by typicar Chineze dat never study Engrish in primary schoor.

The national food of Malaysia is the Ramli Burger, which is banned in 76 countries up to date. The 'beef' patties are made from (believe it or not)parts of unwanted, dead, donkey parts, such as the nose and dick and testicles, which are flattened using pin rollers and sewed into a patty. The sick and the [[furry|fckn mad]] would've loved that. Those sick fucks.

The capital of Malaysia is Babi Lumpur, which is pretty much just like New York City, only it's about 500% full of shit and has significantly more violent crime. Although Malaysian routinely  do crimes from time to time, they simply cannot contain the crime rate, as the favourite national pastime in Malaysial is stealing other people's worthy shit. 

'''Executing''', be it criminals or Christian priests, are their second most popular national pastime after [[pedophile|badminton]]. 

Malaysia's badminton Olympic team regularly has felt its fair share of limited success, but this is partially due to the fact that no one plays badminton because its [[Al Gore|gay]].

==Government==
Malaysia is a dictatorship, under the undisputed leadership of Najib Tong Rosak, who slept his way to the position of Head of UMNO. The UMNO, The United Malay National '''terrorist''' Organization, runs the Malaysian government, and they are total crap and a complete waste of time, the citizens should just move to another country if they want a better life. Prior to Tong Rosak's leadership, Malaysia was run by prominent Anti-Jew Activist [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]].

==Anwar Ibrahim==
Another favorite national pastime of the Malaysians is '''sodomy'''. Although it is officially against the 'Islamic' law to practice sodomy, only in rare instances has this law has been enforced, and a study in 2005 by MIT(Malaysian Institute of Technology) has found that 67% of Malaysian males between 20-25 habitually practice sodomy. 

In February 2008, Mr. Anwar Ibrahim, a Malaysian politician/complete trash, led a band of gypsies to usurp the throne of Premier Najib. However Najib countered this by pushing Anwar's dick into prison on accounts of sodomy, and loling at his face and [[lulz]]. A bogus story was cooked up, and Anwar Ibrahim was publicly humiliated like a sicktard pedophile/necro/[[furry]] finally finding out that everyone knows he's a pedo/necro/furry.

==Intranets==
In 2008, Malaysia went through a massive Tech program to implement the Internet into the country, which was absent from the entire country in the past. Experts from Papua New Guinea were hired to implement Internet technology into the country, and Malaysia can now proudly boast a nation wide 55 kbps connection. And now to make that even better. UMNO is planning on frying every single p2p user in the country via the ISP providers. To quote an online newspaper article, "A proposed new law will enable Internet Service Providers (ISP) to suspend or terminate the Internet accounts of P2P (peer-to-peer) users. This new law called the ISP Liability act, will be tabled in Parliament next month." This bunch of hypocrites who after stealing enough money from their citizens to buy billions of CD's, they decide to sodomize em as well.

==National Defense==
''Tentera Udara Diranjang Malaysial'' or Royal Malaysial Air Force was the strongest Airforce in the world. They're have been involved in toughest Battle ever faced by them, that is "Battle Of Subang AFB" at that time they're struggling to survive with repeatedly sunlight which make TUDM personel almost dead. But there isn't malaysial's TUDM personel who Killed In Action. there's just 1 man who "black out" when some of them still struggling to staying alive
