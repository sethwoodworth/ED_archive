'''Slowpoke''' is another [[Pokemon]]-inspired [[meme]] which occurs, usually on purpose, when someone just discovers an important event long after it has occurred. For example, "What is this [[Holocaust]] thingy everyone's talking about? I wish to participate!"  The standard procedure is to mock the [[OP|original poster]] by posting a picture of Slowpoke.
