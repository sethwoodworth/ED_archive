A spoiler is something when you give away a plot element of something, resulting in people becoming [[butthurt]]. They should be [[troll | posted as often as possible]] to every [[forum]] you can think of. The more irrelevant they are to the forum you post them to, the better, since people will be less likely to expect them that way.

Some of the above spoilers are not real, but crowds of potternoobs still got [[butthurt]], resulting in [[lulz]].
