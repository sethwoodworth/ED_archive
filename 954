<b>Bikerfox</b> (Frank P. DeLarzelere) is a creepy 50 year old [[white trash]] [[lolcow]] and [[shameless self promotion|self promoting]] douchebag with an extreme case of [[USI]]. In recent years this skulleted old man (a shady used car part salesman from Tulsa [[IRL]]) has become known [[OTI]] purely for very extensive online faggotry. A [[Bikerfox#Trivia|pathological liar]], he's about as desperate as they come, attempting to milk every ounce of [[e-fame]] he can from his asinine claims - [[spam]]ming forums, MySpace, [[Bikerfox#Self Promotion Faggotry|writing his own Wikipedia article]], crashing bike expos and annoying pedestrians and drivers alike on the streets of Tulsa, Oklahoma - all in some deluded pursuit to become an [[e-celebrity]].  In addition to this, Frank is also known as a [[loli]] hunter amongst the citizens of Tulsa as a result of his [[Bikerfox#IRL_Pedo|overt fixation]] with jailbait. Bikerfox's is one of '''the''' primary examples of how to [[fail]] hard at the internets, his [[Bikerfox#Gallery|galleries of faggotry]] [http://www.bikerfox.com/glamourshots/index.htm are extensive], and unfortunately many young minds have already been scarred for life by Frank's online [[faggotry|antics]].  

==Internets "Fame"==

[[Image:Bikerfox buttsecks.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bikerfox enjoys long walks on the beach, fancy restaurants...and getting [[buttsecks|fucked in the ass]]]]

It is important to note that [[Bikerfox]]'s entire existence as a supposed [[e-fame|e-celebrity]] has always been, and continues to be, solely the product of his own surgical machinations to [[attention whore|promote]] his own name. [[Bikerfox]]'s [[irl]] claim is that he is a "mountainbiking expert" who holds a [[You win the prize|Guinness Record]] as the first person ever to do a front-flip <i>off</i> of a mountainbike. It has become sweet [[irony]] that the entire platform for the <i>supposed</i> "e-fame" has been revealed to be an outright lie (you will not find the record in the [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/default.aspx Guinness database]).   A clear case of a mid-life crisis, he has attempted to promote himself in any way possible.  He has consistently sought to portray himself in the manner of a "[[unfunny|wacky]]" rebel, but comes across as creepy, over-the-hill, 5th rate Tony Robbins, spewing [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] life philosophies he read off a bumper sticker as if they were his own like some wannabe [[guru]].  Frank's social ineptitude, [[pedo|strange behavior]] around young women, lack of any self-conscious restraint, and extensive history of online faggotry, tend to suggest an [[an hero|appropriate denouement]].  

[[Some argue|Some question]] whether Frank may in fact be some manner of uber troll - [[ED]] assures you that he is in fact one of the most shameless [[ego|megalomaniac]]s on the internet.  Frank enjoys [[Victim complex|playing the victim]] any chance he gets and has continually attempted to play off any criticism he receives from others, both online and IRL, as just some form of friendly [[no|teasing in good fun]].   The term [[unwarranted self importance]] truly fails to adequately describe [[Bikerfox]] since, for all intents and purposes, Frank's only apparent talent is his ability to spread his [[delicious cake|lie]]s to the public.  Frank is a prime example of how the "I don't care what people think, I'm gonna be who I want to be" life-philosophy tends to be a common mantra of [[retards|people]] who rarely consider whether they in fact <i>should</i>. <BR><BR><BR>

[[Image:Bikerfox threatens lolsuits.JPG|thumb|right|420px|Bikerfox is also fan of [[lolsuit]]s]]
Yes...he wrote his own [[TOW]] article. 

EDiot research revealed that Frank <s>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bikerfox&offset=20061023182710&action=history wrote his own TOW article] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bikerfox]</s> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bikerfox_%282nd_nomination%29 Deleted].  Being warned about TOW's [[auto-fellatio|auto-biography]] rules didn't stop him of course as he continued to edit and promote his own article (through a shitload of [[sockpuppets]]).  He even tried to bribe tow admins (see below) to keep the article from being deleted (note admittance of writing his own article).  

Upon its deletion Bikerfox provided even more lulz in his attempts to keep the article by claiming he was about to become a "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bikerfox&diff=next&oldid=189360278 superstar]" and "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bikerfox_(2nd_nomination)&diff=prev&oldid=188093103 I'm a multi-millionaire]".  Unfortunately for Frank, none of it worked (see one of his sockpuppets [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:68.12.57.246#Final_warning talk pages] for moar).  His level of [[ego|megalomania]] would almost be impressive if it wasn't so pathetic, seeing as few have ever attempted to promote so much from so little.  

'''<big>UPDATE:</big> '''His [[TOW]] article <s>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:COI/N#Bikerfox is up for deletion (again)]</s> &nbsp;'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bikerfox_%282nd_nomination%29 <font style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">DELETED!</font>].

[[Image:Image-Pedobear peeking.png|right|60px|loli?]]
Bikerfox is a very creepy old man.  But not only this, he's displayed some disturbing tendencies IRL as well.  One visit to any of his websites and something will jump out at you immediately.  Frank spends suspicious amounts of time pursuing very uncomfortable looking [[jb|underage girls]] and coercing them to take pictures with him every chance he gets.  This is to the point that he posts every [[cp|picture]] he can get with on his webpage(s) with any girls who happen to have had the misfortune of meeting him, most likely to try and convince people he is [[No|popular with the opposite sex]].  He demonstrates the similar disturbing behavior on his Myspace(s) as well, a large number of the girls on his [[friends]] list being underage as well, several being '''only 14 or 15 years old''' [http://www.myspace.com/bikerfoxidol] [http://www.myspace.com/bikerfoxidol2].  It is important to note that this man is nearly 50 years old.  

Most disturbingly though, he also enjoys recording [[loli|underage]] highschool cheerleaders and putting the [http://www.bikerfox.com/foxfriends/jenks/ footage on his website without permission].  This seems to be a common pattern of behavior with Bikerfox and since he remains [[fbi|unv&]] it would probably be a wise thing to keep your kids away from him.  Srsly, can you explain all this [[sick fuck|Frank]]?   {{clear}}

==== Bikerfox Arrested! ====
[[Image:Bikerfox_Tulsa_county_jail.jpg|thumb|right|The sex offender database isn't far off.]]
Bikerfox was arrested in October, 2007, for '''"Bike Rage"'''.  Apparently, he became quite angry and [http://forums.mtbr.com/showthread.php?t=347834 threw his bike at a motorist] who had been trying to do the world a favour by putting Frank out of his misery.  Frank is, of course, praying that he will be found guilty since a [[prison]] sentence would in fact mean plenty of daily powerbottom [[buttsecks]] and the steady diet of [[cum|protein]] necessary for him to [[Faggotry|perform at a consistantly high level]].  

[[Image:Bikerfox mugshot.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bikerfox's recent mugshot [http://iic.tulsacounty.org/InmateDetails.aspx?Id=1177696]. it'll only be a matter of time before he's charged for [[pedophilia|more serious crimes]]. Also, for some reason, he looks like Riff Raff.]]

==Reality TV?==
[[Image:BikerFoxQueen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bikerfox recently decided he wanted to be [[Muhammad Cartoons|as popular as the Danish.]]]]
At the moment, Bikerfox is also trying to get his own [[television|Reality TV]] show launched as well.  We shit you not.  This makes sense though because, really, who wouldn't want to watch the day to day life of an over-the-hill, balding, mulleted, talentless, 50 year old, poser, cosplay, pedophile...[[amirite]]?
Biker Fox also recently became a true [[Put Shoe On Head|shoe on head]] advocate [http://bikerfox.com/livevideo/ setting up several webcams in his home/workplace], lol he sells used car parts IRL. (IE only. username: bikerfox, pass: bikerfox). <br>

==Dubious Business Practices==
As noted, Frank is [http://www.billionsandtrillionsinc.com a used car part salesman IRL] under the business names '''Billions and Trillions''', '''MonopolyParts.com''' and '''GTOPartsGuru.com''. Recent research has also revealed that Frank is known for [[Theft|extortionate price gouging]] and [[Jew gold|unscrupulous business practices]].  He even tried to rip off a dirt poor soldier in Iraq despite having championed himself as a [[Republican|patriotic right winger]] in the past - please see '''[http://www.oldsmobileforums.com/forums/showpost.php?s=665e91993bd753f83edf51b10f6b37a3&p=8746&postcount=20 proof of his scandals here]'''.  <br />

[[Image:Bikerfox_with_Grandma_lolwut.jpg|thumb|right|[[fact|His grandmother is the only sexual partner he's ever had]].]]
Frank recently appeared on a [[Sweden|Swedish]] TV show called "Hundra Höjdare" wherein [[wikipedia:Filip_Hammar_&_Fredrik_Wikingsson|Fredrik and Filip]], two [[Trolling IRL|IRL trolls]], who regularly seek strange people to investigate, interviewed Bikerfox at his home.    
Frank proceeds with his [[unfunny|wacky]] fucktardedness, [[trying too hard|attempting]] to impress viewers by [[tranny|dressing up as an old lady]] (see: Norman Bates), screaming like an [[aspie]] for no reason, falling off his bike...essentially the same faggotry as always (apparently Frank doesn't treat his employees very well). The interview starts with the announcer calling him the [[ADD|ADHD Man]] (Used in Sweden as an insult meaning hyperactive/annoying/obnoxious).  Throughout the interview, the interviewers keep making fun of him,talking behind his back and so forth.

==Arrested...again==
[[Image:Bikerfox_owned_by_cop.jpg|thumb|right|]]
Currently '''Bikerfox''' is still displaying his man-wares at various underage girls on [[MySpace]].  However, recently it seems there was an outbreak of [[common sense]] by his local PD.  Bikerfox was arrested, yet again, this time for [http://www.thelostogle.com/2008/12/09/tulsa-tuesday-biker-fox-arrested/ assaulting a police officer].  Essentially, Frank was fucking with a Tulsa county officer who promptly [[pwnd]] his over-the-hill ass with a swift beating.   

"[[Nobody cares|I was beat up choked and hurt by the Tulsa Police Yesterday. The hate of one Tulsa cop could bring down the Whole Police force. The other cops are sitting around laughing. The news reporter from channel 6 was laughing. She thought it was funny the Police assaulted BF, see kids the Police are not your friend. Why? Because most of the other cops support the haters in the Force.  The good cops support the hate of the bad cops.  
Go figure?]]" - '''from his [http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=3947967&blogID=454500890 whiny blog] about the incident'''

Basically, lulz.
