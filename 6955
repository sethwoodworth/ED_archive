(12:32:26) (#djbb) My child goes to a school with over 9,000 students, and during gym class the other kids block him from using the pool

(12:39:26) (#jb) Hay.
(12:39:28) * DL (DL@c-68-57-116-115.hsd1.va.comcast.net) has joined #autism

(12:39:37) (#dl) lol hi thar
(12:39:39) (#chimi) A5h-X have you tried to seek help?
(12:40:11) (#subseven) maybe mudkip is some type of slur
(12:40:20) (#chimi) what is a mudkip?
(12:40:23) (#djbb) Also, some of the students think its funny telling my child to do a "barrel roll", whatever that is.
(12:40:24) (#subseven) like kike or something
(12:40:29) (#dl) lol
(12:40:31) (#djbb) He often comes home screaming "do a barrel roll"
(12:40:31) (#dl) mudkip
(12:40:32) (#dl) is lik
(12:40:34) (#dl) well
(12:40:40) (#dl) mudkips are like
(12:40:47) (#dl) i really cant explain it
(12:40:50) (#dl) they are the most
(12:40:53) (#dl) beautiful
(12:40:56) (#dl) thing in the world
(12:41:02) (#subseven) so you liek them?
(12:41:04) (#dl) i mean i heard u guyz liek em
(12:41:08) (#chimi) does this have to do with autism?
(12:41:12) (#dl) YES
(12:41:12) (#chimi) is it some like
(12:41:23) (#chimi) oh
(12:41:32) (#subseven) should i liek them too?
(12:41:36) (#dl) DONT EVEN QUESTION THE IMPORTANCE OF MUDKIPS
(12:41:36) (#jew) one of the children screems SO I HERD YOU LIKE MUDKIPZ?
(12:41:38) (#chimi) will my child liek mudkips?
(12:41:46) (#dl) my child luvs mudkips
(12:41:48) (#dl) if he didnt
(12:41:50) (#dl) id beat him
(12:42:01) (#jew) that is not very nice
(12:42:01) (#djbb) Lately my child has been insisting hes changing his name to "Anonymous", and loudly boasts "Anonymous does not forgive"
(12:42:06) (#subseven) should i make mine liek them?
(12:42:07) (#djbb) I'm rather frightened at this sort of behavious :/
(12:42:10) (#chimi) omg
(12:42:12) (#chimi) djbb 
(12:42:20) (#chimi) you must get your child help
(12:42:33) (#dl) djbb
(12:42:40) (#djbb) Well I took him to see his psychiatrist, Professor Moot
(12:42:44) (#dl) i think you should let your child see a doctor
(12:42:47) (#djbb) But he insists this is normal behavious
(12:42:52) (#dl) he may have what they call /b/tardism
(12:42:57) (#chimi) so autism and mudkips are related
(12:43:05) (#dl) in everyway possible
(12:43:06) (#chimi) this is some interesting and informative information
(12:43:14) (#chimi) this place is such a huge help

(12:44:10) (#chimi) i've heard things about autistic children beliving that the jews did wtc
(12:44:14) (#chimi) is this true as well?

(12:45:13) (#dl) to
(12:45:16) (#dl) touch yourself
(12:45:19) (#djbb) I remember a few months ago a particular group of violent students would push my child into mud and physically assault him, he came home with several bruises one day. Hes so innocent, I don't know why people would do that sort of thing to a child unable to defend himself. Then he was telling me how one child even threatened to kill him, thats when I got scared and told him hes moving with his aunty and uncle in bel-air

(12:51:52) (#chimi) awww
(12:51:55) (#djbb) But I've had to discipline him lately, he picked up some really naughty language on the playground
(12:51:56) (#chimi) do you have a pic of it perhaps?
(12:51:58) * JB (Kev@ACC3ED74.ipt.aol.com) has joined #autism
(12:52:02) (@Darkman) ok
(12:52:02) (#djbb) Lately whenever he sees a girl hes never met before
(12:52:13) (@Bambi) DL  watch the language in here please
(12:52:15) (#dl) tits or gtfo?
(12:52:15) (@Darkman) DL you please reframe from saying those things
(12:52:16) (#djbb) He tells her to "show her t**ts or get the f*** out"
(12:52:23) (#chimi) :O
(12:52:25) (#djbb) Its really quite odd
(12:52:25) --- Darkman sets ban on *!*@c-68-57-116-115.hsd1.va.comcast.net
(12:52:26) (#chimi) that's terrible
(12:52:26) * Bambi has kicked DL from #autism (Bambi)
(12:52:27) --- Bambi sets ban on *!*DL@*.hsd1.va.comcast.net
(12:52:33) (#jb) hay my mommy said this is a safe place to chat
(12:52:35) (#djbb) I don't want to spank him though, since he can't help it
(12:52:37) (#subseven) dayam
(12:52:38) (#jew) that DL is a bad man
(12:52:51) (@Bambi) he is a gone one from here now 
(12:52:55) (#subseven) you guys are kind of violent in this channel
(12:52:59) (#jew) that is nice
(12:53:04) (#jb) who is the dl
(12:53:08) (#chimi) thank you for kicking him
(12:53:08) (@Darkman) just the bad peeps that come here
(12:53:13) (#chimi) i find that offensive
(12:53:21) (#chimi) do you get lots of them Darkman?
(12:53:22) (@Bambi) we all did
(12:53:27) (#djbb) Do you guys think its wrong spanking an autistic child? I personally don't want to do it, but sometimes when he gets out of control, I question my morales
(12:53:28) (@Darkman) not really
(12:53:55) (#jb) whatt is wrong with him
(12:53:57) (#jew) i have to spank my brother some times, because he will pull the dogs hair out
(12:54:02) (Arsanerit) What is spanking?
(12:54:06) (@Darkman) just people tring to bump authority
(12:54:13) (#chimi) ah
(12:54:19) (@Darkman) discipline your children
(12:54:20) (@Bambi) i dont want to say spankings are good but i  did spank my children when they was younger  when they did bad things but  they didnt work with my son at all
(12:54:29) (Arsanerit) Discipline by using violence?
(12:54:33) (Arsanerit) I think it is wrong to use violence.
(12:54:41) (#subseven) pain conditioning isn't bad....it's been around for ages
(12:54:50) (@Darkman) some would say negative motivation
(12:54:51) (Arsanerit) I think it's bad.
(12:54:54) (#subseven) sometimes its all taht works
(12:54:59) (Arsanerit) I disagree.
(12:55:02) (#jew) sometimes it is nessisary, because my younger brother onnce killed our cat
(12:55:06) (#jew) by sitting on him
(12:55:09) (Arsanerit) I think it's banned here.
(12:55:13) (#subseven) were you spanked Arsanerit?
(12:55:16) (Arsanerit) No.
(12:55:23) (#subseven) well there you go
(12:55:23) (#chimi) my step dad used to beat me with a paint mixer
(12:55:29) (Arsanerit) subseven: What do you mean?
(12:55:32) (#jew) but what about spankings when my brother killed the ca
(12:55:33) (#chimi) it had my name on it and everything
(12:55:45) (#djbb) Does anyone know what "shoop da whoop" means?
(12:55:46) (@Bambi) beating and spanking are 2 totally different things 
(12:55:46) (#subseven) thats' why your such a pussy ass liberal now
(12:55:48) (#djbb) My childs been saying it alot
(12:56:00) (Arsanerit) subseven: I'm not a liberal. I'm a socialist.
(12:56:08) (Arsanerit) subseven: What makes you think I'm a liberal?
(12:56:09) (#subseven) same thing
(12:56:10) (#jb) i  dont like this chatt it's not nice
(12:56:11) (#jew) subsevern that is not nice
(12:56:11) (Arsanerit) No.
(12:56:12) (@Bambi) jew  that is just he needs more supervision
(12:56:20) (#a5h-x) sometimes ricky leaves his mouth wide open for hours on end. he says he is "charging his lazer". I just lose hope sometimes.
(12:56:20) (#chimi) moar nice plz
(12:56:23) (Arsanerit) Liberals favour laissez-faire economy,
(12:56:42) (#jb) im getting my mommy
(12:56:51) (Arsanerit) Liberals favour laissez-faire economy, less social welfare, more freedom for corporations, socialists favour publicly owned economy, more social welfare, more rights for workers.
(12:56:52) (#chimi) does your mommy liek mudkips?
(12:56:59) (Arsanerit) I am not a liberal.
(12:57:16) (@Bambi) subseven please watch language 
(12:57:23) (Arsanerit) JB: Usually this chat is very nice.
(12:57:36) (#chimi) so what problems should i look for in an autistic child
(12:57:51) (Arsanerit) You should not look for problems. You should look for talents.
(12:58:00) (#chimi) i do not want my child hanging it's mouth open saying he's "charging his lazer"
(12:58:08) (#jb) This is Tommy's mom, what seems to be the problem in here? my son is upset.
(12:58:10) (#chimi) or putting his shoe on his head
(12:58:15) (#jew) my little brother is talented at counter strike, he likes "pooning noobs"
(12:58:21) (Arsanerit) JB: How old is your son?
(12:58:22) (#chimi) pooning!?
(12:58:23) (#djbb) Should I let my autistic child watch television unsupervised? Lately hes been referring to teenage girls as "jailbait' and I don't know where he got it from
(12:58:28) (#jew) he says he wants to "rais his raink on the server"
(12:58:30) (@Bambi) well chimi  if they are autistic you dont look for problems you deal with them 
(12:58:35) (#jb) He is seventeen.
(12:58:38) (@Darkman) bbl tonite
(12:58:43) (@Darkman) work time for me
(12:58:44) (#chimi) by dealing do you mean spanking?
(12:58:48) (#chimi) what if he comes after me
(12:58:49) (#jb) I thought this was a safe place for him.
(12:58:49) (Arsanerit) djbb: That's normal.
(12:58:52) * Darkman has quit (Why do they call it hen peck? At least I can kick the crap out of a chicken.)

(A5h-X) sometimes ricky leaves his mouth wide open for hours on end. he says he is "charging his lazer". I just lose hope sometimes.

(13:00:35) (jew) guys i just cought my brother masterbating to black women having sex with white men
(13:00:43) (A5h-X) yes indeed, jew. He shall feel my wrath "like the fist of an angry god"

(13:00:24) (djbb) Whenever he calls someone, he says "desu call home" before he starts dialing

(12:32:26) (djbb) My child goes to a school with over 9000 students, and during gym class the other kids block him from using the pool
(12:32:31) (djbb) They tell him its "closed due to AIDs"

(12:34:52) * Bambi <------has a son 19 with pdd/nos...ocd...seizures... we are from midwest..usa

(12:35:01) (subseven) my boy tries to use the library...and they block him and chant "desu desu desu"....it's not nice at all

(12:36:18) (subseven) one of them asked me if i liked mudkips

(12:38:45) (A5h-X) ricky keeps rocking back and forth and groaning "ah herd u liek mupkipz"

12:39:04) (subseven) i just think maybe it's connected somehow....you know....the desu and the mudkips

(12:39:21) (djbb) I tried telling Principal Anonymous, but he told me that the only thing they could do was watch out for that sort of behaviour.

(12:40:11) (subseven) maybe mudkip is some type of slur

(12:40:23) (djbb) Also, some of the students think its funny telling my child to do a "barrel roll", whatever that i

(12:40:31) (djbb) He often comes home screaming "do a barrel roll"

(12:40:31) (DL) mudkip

(12:42:01) (djbb) Lately my child has been insisting hes changing his name to "Anonymous", and loudly boasts "Anonymous does not forgive" 

(12:42:40) (djbb) Well I took him to see his psychiatrist, Professor Moot

(12:42:52) (DL) he may have what they call /b/tardism

12:44:10) (chimi) i've heard things about autistic children beliving that the jews did wtc
