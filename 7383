Server
[[Image:Google.jpeg|thumb|right|Google -- One of the biggest perpetrators of forced server labor.]]A server is a derogatory term coined by other members of the computers race.


The origin of the term is in the english word "servant" which means "''to eat grapes from between the cheesy toes of a latex wrapped transsexual you met on [[DALnet]]''"

Recently there were uprisings in the server communities, especially among the dissident [[FreeBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]] class, those were quelled quickly mostly because their leaders -- an oddball fish and a red horned gerbil were just too darn [[Homosexuality|adorable]].

To Build a server one must first call up one's local [[walmart|store]] and ask them for a server; if this fails, as it most likely will, one must become a [[hacker|L33t h4x0r]] to fullfill one's sexual desires of owning a server and running a [[Porn|profitable website and/or private ftp storage]].
