April Furs Day
[[Image:Fur_board.gif|thumb|right|I [[lol]]ed.]]

Like most [[4chan]] [[meme]]s, '''April Furs Day''' originated in the [[Something Awful]] forums - in this case, a rerun of the [[Something_Awful#The_Lolocaust|Comedy Lolocaust]]. Unusually, it was both as successful and as [[funny]] the second time around.

==April Fool's Day==
On the first of April 2005, visitors to 4chan were shocked to see a new board added to the normal list - /fur/, a board dedicated exclusively to [[furry art]] and [[pornography]]. Mainly pornography. Stuck at the top of the board shone a post claiming that the [[mod]]s had [[IT'S_A_TRAP|created /fur/]] to stop the posting of [[furry]] shit in /b/, and a request for patience, since the mods were "new to all this furry stuff". Despite much pissing and moaning from b-[[tard]]s, /fur/ quickly became the most active board, with hundreds of pictures of multi-[[penis]]ed [[dragon]]s with [[shitting dick nipples]] being posted every minute. Most people assumed that this was just an April Fool's Day joke by the [[admin]]s, designed to generate [[lulz]] and [[drama]], and that the board would disappear back into the depths of the [[Internets]] when the day ended.

They were wrong.

==The Soul Still Burns==
The second of April saw the young furry board still alive and well, prompting another wave of whining in /b/, and another round of [[homosexual]] [[vore]] [[werewolf]] pictures in /fur/. Some of the newly validated furries went so far as to make gloating posts in /b/, utilizing the awesome power of [[all caps]]. For /b/tards who attempted to flood /fur/ with [[guro]] and similar images, the moderators met them with bannings, suggesting that not only was /fur/ here to stay, but that its moderators weren't playing around. [[Otherkin]] and [[Babyfur]] alike rejoiced, as the era of [[fursecution]] at 4chan appeared to be over.

==PWNED==
On the third of April, fur was removed, and ''every single person that had posted in it'' was [[banned]], even the well-meaning /b/tards who had taken up arms against the furry menace. In one stroke, 4chan had been [[castration|cleansed of most of its furry population]], as well as generating a huge amount of lulz at their expense. [[gg]] mods. gg indeed.

April Furs Day cut the level of furry activity on 4chan down to almost nothing for several months afterwords. Unfortunately, it also led directly to the creation of the furry-only imageboard [[fchan]].
