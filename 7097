'''Rubberduc''' aka [[User:Crayolacrime|''Crayolacrime'']] aka ''Dylan'' (1980-March of 2007) was [[Girlvinyl]]'s husband and one of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|ED]]'s first [[sysop]]s. One of history's foremost [[internet stalking]] innovators, he spent countless hours honing his skills on [[IRC]] and [[livejournal]]. [[Some argue|Painfully extensive studies showed]] that [[Jacknstock|blocking him is was one of the dumbest things an admin could do]]. Proved [[IRL]] that sometimes, it really is [[Lupus]].

[[some argue|Some say]] they can still hear it in the wind. If the internet [[Ted Stevens|really was a big truck]], it would would not be big enough to fit [[The Giver|his mighty girth]].
