'''Ty "One-Eyed Ty" Ziegel''' is a [[United States]] [[Military|Marine Corps]] Sergeant who got turned into the [[Pwn|Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] by an [[Iraq]]i suicide bomber in 2004. Instead of [[GTFO|running away from the burning truck]] he threw a temper tantrum and wouldn't leave without his ''[[Pokemon]]'' cards. When he got back home he became a symbol of undying love when he married his [[girlfriend]] in a ceremony that was equal parts [[Gay|romance]] and [[guro]]. True love didn't last long for Ty when his [[wife]] realized that she was sorta [[hott]] and didn't have to fuck a full-grown [[Harlequin Ichthyosis Fetus|Harlequin Ichthyosis fetus]].

==[[Fucktard|Join The Army]] They Said...==

Though it doesn't look like it now, Ty Ziegel was once an [[NORP|ordinary person]], just like [[you]] and [[me]]. Ty had a pretty - albeit [[chubby]] - girl, and a nice, quiet hometown. However, Ty was a [[Stupid|patriotic]] man, and the events of [[9/11]] made him realize that he wanted to personally hunt down and kill every friggin' [[Muslim|sandnigger]] he could get his hands on. So he joined the Marines.

Sometime along his second tour, he was driving along the [[Terrorist|Syrian]] border, minding his own business. Suddenly, a suicide bomber jumped out in front of his Hummer, [[John Locke|shit got a little crazy]], and he ended up being the human version of [[Zippocat]].

Back in [[White Trash]], [[Indiana]], Ty's betrothed, Renee, was enjoying a day of [[Cuckoldry|fucking her neighbor while her fiancee was away]]. Suddenly the phone rang. She learned the horrible news about Ty. Quickly she ran outside and [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "fresh", and it had dice in the mirror. If anything, I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo, homes, to Bel-Air!"]]

==Recovery and Marriage==
When Renee saw her fiancee again, he was seriously fucked up. One arm was missing past the forearm and his remaining hand had only two fingers. His big toe was grafted on in place of a thumb. One eye was blind and milky, as if melted, and his ears had been burnt away. The top of his skull had been removed and inserted by doctors into the fatty tissue inside his torso to keep it viable and moist for future use. He was a fucking disaster. And he was in a coma to boot.

Doctors feverishly worked to keep Ty alive. Some fifteen surgeries and eighteen months later, Ty emerged a new man, a new man who looked like a fucking [[zombie]]. Nevertheless, Renee was a sturdy, Midwestern girl. She couldn't let a little thing like her man being turned into a [[Kill it with fire|pork rind]] get in the way of true love, after all. A few months later, the happy couple was married, making for one of the most hilariously terrifying wedding photos of all time.

==Birth of a Meme==
Ty would have probably led a life that was relatively normal if it weren't for the heroic actions of one crazed [[B|/b/]]tard with a fetish for capturing disfigured soldiers. She was there at the wedding to document the entire thing. When a nation was confronted with these gruesome images, they gave a collective gasp and asked, "Holy shit! Are these [[Adobe® Photoshop®|shooped]]?" After figuring out that this monster did indeed exist, the public was so awed that they gave the artist an [[Vox Dramatica prize|award]].

Naturally, [[B|/b/]] [[oh exploitable|smelled blood in the water]] and turned Ty into a [[mini meme]]. Ty's image was [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|cruelly photomanipulated]] over and over again, usually with the caption "'JOIN THE ARMY,' THEY SAID," - a quote from the hit game, ''[[Halo]]''. This infuriated the two or three [[Republican]] [[faggots]] who hang out on [[B|/b/]], predictably leading to [[butthurt]] [[flame wars]] and [[epic]] [[lulz]].

==Ty Today==
[[Image:Tycookie.jpg|right|thumb|BAWWW BAWW! HE WAS DELICIOUSLY BAKED FOR YOUR FREEDOMS!!1]]
Ty continued to support the war in [[Iraq]] and [[W|President Bush]] despite his terminal case of [[ugly]]. To this day, he will [[Divide by zero|stoically defend the administration that turned him into a walking sideshow]]. Ty's brother is a Marine as well, and probably hopes the suicide bomber who hits his convoy when he is deployed to [[Iraq]] kills him instead of making him into his brother.

Meanwhile, he was having some marital problems with Renee. She was getting a bit sick of getting humped by Sloth from ''The Goonies''. Ty had also become incapable of doing a lot of basic things on his own, a remnant of being in a coma for over a year and losing his dominant hand. Finally, after about a year of marriage, she decided to [[GTFO]] while she was still young and attractive enough to get a decent-looking husband.

{{quote|Renee and Ty are thinking about having children soon. “We want to be young, cool parents,” says Rene.|[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1294008.ece The Times.uk Article], [[lol]] sweet [[irony]].}}

Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before Ty plays the [[shotgun mouthwash]] card and becomes [[an hero]].
