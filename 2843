Fake journal
A '''fake journal''' is a [[journal]] that is not your main journal, created usually for [[troll|trolling]] or picking up guys. Also see [[sock puppet]].

A fake journal can be a parody of another OL journal ([[mediacart]]), a fictional character (batfurry (disputed)), a celebrity (usually non-[[Internet celebrity]], like george_w_bush), or a concept (like [[anal sex]]).
