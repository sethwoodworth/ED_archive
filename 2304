Djna
{{lj|djna}}, aka [http://iam.bmezine.com/?thatsenseofpar thatsenseofpar], is currently [[Josephthelover]]'s [[gay]] [[lover]].

The [[completely irrelevant history]] behind the Djna/Josephthelover [[cat fight]] is currently unknown, due to [[sockpuppet]]ry and [[NPOV|POV]] [[drama]]. However, according to [[popular belief]], Djna seriously [[pwned]] Josephthelover when he left over a hundred messages on every [[LiveJournal]] post of his he could find. Things went on like this for over two months before Josephthelover finally declared open war against Djna.

{{lj|Josephthelover}}, the world's second-worst [[sock puppet]]eer, launched a [[fail|full scale attack]] against Djna. Using his [[unlimited disposable income]] and his [[Internet stalking]] skills, he managed to find out Djna's [[IP]]. With that amazing discovery, Josephthelover proceeded to create an [[ED]] article about the results of his research and to gloat about it in a [http://www.livejournal.com/users/djna/31218.html?thread=191986#t191986 comment] at Djna's LJ, using a cunning [[sock puppet]]. He claimed that he had successfully [[Salt the Earth|salted the earth]] for Djna, hoping that he would have to [[Deleting your LiveJournal|delete his LiveJournal]] and leave the [[Internets]] forever.

However, Josephthelover's cunning plan was foiled by the [[dramacrat]]s at [[ED]], who ruined his whole life by pointing out his lame attacks against Djna. The upshot of the whole ordeal was that, after a lot of confusion on the [[Talk:Djna|talk page]], this article was protected -- a state which lasted for over two years, because after the drama died down everyone forgot these faggots ever existed.
