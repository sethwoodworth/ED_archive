==[[Vancouver]] 24h Strike Poll==
Some Anon came by a local news site featuring a poll about a strike in Vancouver, and regardless of the content [[Anonymous]] felt that it was his duty to vote for the right thing. Due to [[Computer Science III|retarded web coding]] the poll was easily to be set in Anon's favor. After a glorious victory, with more than 20000 votes for [[Pool's closed|Pools closed]], the maintainer of the poll [[baleet]]ed it and made a new one, thereby resetting all votes to 0. This did not stop Anonymous who quickly regained 100% of the poll.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:PollNotPrinted.jpg|thumb|[[Shocked and Appalled|I am shocked and appalled sir!]] Also note, www.24hrs.ca isn't their website - [[fail]].]]
Being [[owned]] so hard, the paper decided to not print the results of the poll. Of course anything Anonymous does has to be seen as a hacking attempt and so Vancouver 24h responded the next day with a new poll, full of [[retarded]] options to make the site look [[rad]]. Anon soon began voting for "RAM them", because it shows how little they know about computers. Once again they laid waste on the poll to show them their master.
