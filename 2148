The '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RIP Deceased Wikipedians]''' page on Wikipedia is [[TOW]]'s memorial to those that worked so [[erection|hard]] on editing the wiki, that due to mental exhaustion as a result of writing too many [[featured article]]s, their physical bodies just [[death|gave up on them]].

Many Deceased [[Wikipedo]]s were experts in their subject field, and many of them came from all walks of life, and from many different [[armenia|places]] around the world. The one thing they had in common, however, was the ability to [[fellatio|please]] King [[Jimbo]] and his cash cow, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. Whilst they spent their last days seriously ill on [[recent changes patrol]] instead of with their friends and family, Jimbo was out slaying the newest head of the [[dragon]] that is his endless [[sex]] drive, which just keeps growing [[moar]] and [[moar]] heads and breathing [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|fire]] like the [[holocaust|oven]] in which these nazi Wikipedos' remains are being charred, BBQd in wikipedo hell.

==Causes of Deceased Wikipedians==
No normal website would have such a high rate of death amongst its userbase. This could be because many of its users are relatively [[old]] in comparison with the [[16-year-old girl]]s who use [[social networking]] sites, but a more widely accepted theory has strong evidence that [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|Wikipedia admins]] are the ones that are causing people to [[HNNNNNNGGGGG|die suddenly]] due to stress. They also give them the shits, so that they died while on the toilet.

Since Wikipedo admins are often [[13-year-old boy]]s, due to their teenage angst they like to disrespect those with more knowledge than them, thus it is no coincidence that TOW loses experts rather than [[vandal]]s. These experts often climbed back into their [[hugbox]] when blocked for violating 3RR and writing [[original research]] and using unreliable sources, by users like [[Sceptre]] and [[Ryulong]], and some of them never made it back out alive. It is thought that the [[Bureaucratic Fuck]]s communicated by [[email]] to get Sceptre removed from his adminship position for this reason. However, Sceptre himself has also recently admitted several times to being 'ill', so we could yet see Sceptre become a Deceased Wikipedian in the near future.

However, all Wikipedos are mortal, and within a period of time, there will be [[over 9000]] Wikipedos listed there, and not a single one of them with any [[article]] about them on Wikipedia. Work like a slave; die like a slave!

Also, being dead is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Rob_Levin blockable offence] on Wikipedia!

==Deceased [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]ns==
There is currently <s>not</s> a "[[Deceased Encyclopedia Dramaticans]]" page. However there is broad [[some argue|consensus]] that any [[EDiot]] who died would instantly get an [[article]] here, and it would be frontpaged immediately upon hearing the news. A memorial to any dead Ã¦ contributor would surely be [[the best]] thing one could wish for, because most [[NORP]]s and [[breeder]]s die and are forgotten to the universe eternally (because we know [[atheist|atheism]] is true), with their corpses rotting in a grave, but [[you]] could have eternal [[lulz]] in the afterlife as we [[party hard]] once you have become [[an hero]]. [[Do it faggot]].

Latest reports suggest that [[User:Drunkenlazybastard|Drunkenlazybastard]] is the [[Death List|most likely candidate]] to die soon of all ED users. Since he is a [[drug]] user and a [[faggot]], the chances of becoming infected with [[AIDS]] are statistically much higher for him than the rest of us.

[[Last Thursday]] the [[homosexual]] Wikipedia editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffpw Jeffpw] died, although it is not fully known [[AIDS|what the cause of death was]]. Jeffpw was involved with the [[faggotry|LGBT]] [[WikiProject]] and until his dying day campaigned for the [[paradox|rights of homosexuals in Iran]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&oldid=232160990#Adding_Jeffpw_to_Wikipedia:Deceased_Wikipedians.3F A post] at the [[administrators' noticeboard]] suggested that it might be appropriate to add him to the list.

It is believed that Jeff died not long after his gay lover Isaac died. Seriously. There's photos of themselves on Wikipedia and everything. Isaac [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffpw/Isa%C3%A4c%27s_Memorial_Page died] in late June. Jeff [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffpw/Memoriam died] just a few days ago. It is believed that he became [[an hero]] after Isaac's death from [[AIDS]].

{{quote|Jeff gave [[over 9,000]] edits to this project, working [[erection|hard]] to help our [[piss|aim]] - the [[goatse|gift]] to the world of a [[totalitarian state|free encyclopedia]] containing the [[girlvinyl's vagina|sum of all human knowledge]].}}

[[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] is going to inform [[Fred Phelps]] of this. [[Maybe]]. Plz to be adding other interesting cases like this to this page OK?

We also find it amusing that Jeff may be put onto the list, whilst the [[Wikipedia:Bruce_Edwards_Ivins|Anthrax Killer]] who [[Wikipedia:Special:Contributions/Jimmyflathead|edited Wikipedia]] will never be on the list. [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/07/jimmy_wales_and_jimmyflathead/ Proof].

Also, this very section of this Wikipedia article caused what we might term [[butthurt]] at this [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=19748 Wikipedia Review thread] (only members can view). Amongst the lulzier quotes from the thread:

{{quote|Do you mean to say that Encyclopedia Dramatica wrote something [[IDIFTL|appallingly antisocial and mean-spirited about a real-life person]]? Stop the presses. The only thing remarkable about that incident is that the undertow is actually trying to lecture someone named "[[ByAppointmentTo|Warm, Sticky Cum Fountain]]."|Some Wikipedia Review poster.}}

{{quote|It's really unfortunate what these losers will do to people. To me, there should be a policy on ED [[ED:LULZ|opposite of Wikipedia's BLP]]. ED is obviously a site of [[drama|bullshit garbage]]. So, while I don't agree with the trolling on [[NawlinWiki|living people]], such as myself, I can at least appreciate the [[lulz|humor]] in it. There is, however, [[lies|no humor in spewing unfunny hate at the dead]]. And I can't help but feel bad for the [[13-year-old boy|kid]]s writing this shit, because most of them have probably had some [[Josef Fritzl|fucked up childhoods to turn out as they have]].|[[LaraLove]]}}

==Cumulus Clouds==
[[Image:Death-olneyclayton-2009010-199x300.jpg|thumb|Clayton Taylor Olney]]
'''Clayton Taylor Olney''' who went by the username '''Cumulus Clouds''' is thought to be the first Wikipedian to go [[an hero]]. According to [[JarlaxleArtemis]], he killed himself by shooting himself in the anus. He was 25 years old, and a [[college]] student who lived with his parents. He contributed a load of [[shit nobody cares about|extremely interesting articles dealing with very important issues]] and uploaded his own pics to [[Wikimedia Commons]]. Moar info can be found [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RIP#Clayton_Olney_.28Cumulus_Clouds.29 here] and [http://www.issaquahpress.com/2009/01/05/clayton-taylor-olney/ here].

==JPatrickBedell==
John Patrick Bedell was a middle-aged computer programmer and editor of pages about conspiracy theories at TOW. He was devoted to the [[Zeitgeist|9/11 "truth" movement]], suffered from [[bipolar disorder]] and had an unlimited supply of [[marijuana]] grown in his own basement. This were probably contributing factors to his attempt at taking down [[The Man]] on the 4th of March 2010. With his 2 9mm's plus extra clips he went to Pentagon, at a checkpoint he threw a couple of shots at some officers which reacted by [[headshot|pwning him with a headshot]]. The police officers were out of the hospital the morning after, John ended in the morgue and the hall of shame with a score of 0.
