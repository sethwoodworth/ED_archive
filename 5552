Paul has gone by the names Greta and Jayne, and on weekends at a suburban Parisian hookah bar as Paula Fuckmuhbutt, where he pays to get horse-fucked as [[Midget|French midgets]] punch him in the nuts he despises because they remind him that he is, biologically, still a man. Paula and the Muzak Faggits conspired in 2006 to make [[Wikipedia]] their personal advertising machine. [[Bureaucratic fucks|ArbCom]] banned both their asses, but not before they created articles about [[Shit nobody cares about|themselves]].  The two then went underground as '''The fieryangel''' on the [[Wikipedia Review]].   Paula [http://independentartistscompany.com/blog.aspx?id=12612 went around telling shitty bands] to stay away from Wikipedia because he was pissed they wouldn't let them re-write opera history to make it look like the music they pimp in their business was the greatest fucking music ever written.  Let's just say the Muzak Faggits have a little [[USI]]....

As recently as April 2008 the [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Hellokittybangbang Muzak Fagits were self-promoting on the French Wikipedia]. 

For the first six months of 2008, Paula created stalked [[the Wikipedia Jews|Wikipedia's Israeli]] faggot [[Wikipedia Porn|pornographer]] and serial self-promoter [[David Shankbone]].  As "the fieryangel" on Wikipedia Review, Somey liked that Paula provided the diffs and the links to trash Wikipedia.  Nobody knew it was Musik Fabrik behind The fieryangel, even on Wikipedia review, until dumbass Paula, wearing his beard man-disguise, joined the Wikipedia Review's Facebook.  Like, how many other opera-loving, saxophone-sucking, Germaine Tailleferre-fucking, expatriate [[furfag|furfaggits]] can there *be* in goddamn France?  Even less, Lagny-sur-Marne, a city of not even 20,000 people, where [http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lagny-sur-Marne&diff=5297530&oldid=5062641 Paula Wedgie wrote that he and his boyfriend Jean-Faggy are celebrities].  Shankbone brilliantly set a trap for this drama bitch (even the fucking name 'the fieryangel' is some big fucking dramatic opera reference nobody gets).  He got his IP from a StatMeter! Shankbone came completely unhinged at Wikipedia, creating [[moar]] dramaz when he was told by double-agent [[Alison]] that unless he's [[Tony Sidaway]], he "must never, ever call a bitch a cunt on Wikipedia."[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:David_Shankbone&diff=next&oldid=212503009] as the last time someone called a woman a [[SlimVirgin|"lying, manipulative cunt"]], [[Blu Aardvark|they]] were banned.  Shankfag vowed to show Paul that the [[The Internet is serious business|Internets is serious fucking business]], [[just for the lulz]].

Paula's self-promotage was Shankbone's pwnage both in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Paul_Wehage&oldid=229217548 English] ''and'' [http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Pages_%C3%A0_supprimer/Paul_Wehage French], even though Paula tried to save his English Wikipedia article by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&curid=5137507&diff=231795210&oldid=231793917 removing a PROD] using an anagram of Shankbone's name, "User:Vanish, Dead Knob" and then he gets blocked while he poses as a [[German]] [[meth]] whore named "Greta".

Paul first found out he was a dramatic faggot in the black hills of North Dakota.  You could say he was "The Asshole of America's Asshole".  Too ashamed to allow him off the ranch, Paul's parents home-schooled him until they could send him off to the moist Armpit of America: Texass.  There he learned to suck off a guy for a nickel until he saved up enough to buy his first saxophone.

Paul, in a typical example of [[USI]], is seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saint_Thomas_Academy&diff=prev&oldid=61726726 adding himself to his shitty school the Saint Thomas Academy on Wikipootia] (and misspelling what he does).

After ArbCom told the Muzak Fagits to plaster their spam somewhere else besides all over the French, Italian, English and German Wikipedias, the two homos left behind their [[Wikipedia:User:Musikfabrik|User:Musikfabrik]] account and ran into the open, loving arms of the concise and intelligent criticism of the [[Wikipedia Review]].

In all his faggotry, still sounding like a [[cunt]] and [[Fucktard]], he tried one last attempt--that mostly worked--on the Wikipediot Review (Neo-Nazis aren't that smart).  The jizz is this: Paul befriended [[Jimbo Wales]] on [[Facebook]] so that he would do him a favor, and blank the ArbCom about his spamming Muzak Fabrik [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|9001]] times on Wikipedia.  Then, according to the fieryangel, he told Jimbo a lie:  he is the fieryangel (when he really is not).  This was a trap Paul set for Jimbo, to see if, after doing him  the favor of blanking the ArbCom, Jimbo would then tell other people that The Fieryangel, who went around to conservative blog "[http://www.lonelyconservative.com/2008/05/wikipedia-vs-lonely-conservative.html The Lonely Conservative]" and fed the [[insane]] bitch there a bunch of bullshit, who vowed to "take Wikipedia apart", who continually ripped Wales a new asshole daily on the WR, whether Wales would betray Paul's trust (after doing him a favor) and spill the lie that The Fieryangel is Paul (when it's not).  Make sense?  No?  Well, here's The Fieryangel's explanation of how he is not Paul and he exposed Jimbo (from the May 13th Wikipedia Review thread courtesy blanked by Neo-Nazi Hypocrite Faggot [[Somey]]):
<blockquote>
Okay, Davie, it's Agatha Christie time...<br><br>
You see, this was a trap. And you fell for it hook, line and sinker.<br><br>
Only one person knew who the Fieryangel was, supposedly. But that was a plant. And the person who was given the information was none other than....<br><br>
Jimbo Wales.<br><br>
Let me start from the beginning: [[Shit nobody cares about|Paul runs Musik Fabrik music publishing, a publishing company who publishes almost all of the work by Germaine Tailleferre published after her death (ie most of the important works)]]. Paul is a [[Faggot|fine saxophonist]] and has [[Yiff|performed]] extensively in festivals devoted to music by [[Feminist|women]], especially those organized by the Donne in Musica foundation. I met him in Fiuggi in 1998, where he did ten premi√®res in three days of new music by women written for him. He's a real inspiration for those of us who believe that women's music is important because he puts his money where his mouth is: he plays the music and he publishes it. He's a very close friend, as is his partner, Jean-Faggy Buttshow.<br><br>
When I heard about the business concerning the List of Important Opera composers on Wikipedia I was horrified. [[Lie|Especially because it was quite clear that neither Jean-Faggy nor Paul was fighting this fight because of any interest they had in this business]]: Paul's reconstruction of Tailleferre's most important opera is still not finished (although I'm told it's getting close), but the opera that he's reconstructing was a failure during it's initial production in 1951. It was an unjust failure, but it was a huge, huge scandale. There is no way that this work could be considered for such a list.<br><br>
[[Gay|But here were two MEN who were fighting for the rights of women]] to be included in the history of Opera...and because they were MEN, they were dragged through the mud. I got really mad. And I'm still mad. And I'm not alone. [[Unwarranted self-importance|You guys blew it big time with this situation and you've paid for it many times over. You will never, ever, get EU cultural funding for a Wikipedia project because of this.]]<br><br>
The Tailleferre situation is extremely complex and Paul is very close to the heir. There was a period in which other parties outside of the Estate were trying to exert control over the Tailleferre work. Paul was essential in stopping that, but he didn't make any friends doing so. At some point, there will be a very big court case involving Tailleferre's manuscripts and the artistic control over her works. At one point, it seemed that this would happen earlier this Spring.<br><br>
Paul really wanted this Boisseau arbcom material off of Wikipedia for many reasons, but mainly because it cited the name of his company and the name of his partner in the title of the Arb-com case itself. He asked me how he should do this. I suggested that he approach Jimbo Wales on Facebook and that he broach the question there, knowing that Wales was most approachable in that venue. He made a friend request, asking for peace, which was accepted by Jimbo and then he made his pitch for the courtesy blanking of the Arb-com case.<br><br>
At my request, as a test, he said that he was me. This was to see if the information would be leaked.<br><br>
It obviously has.<br><br>
What does this tell us about Jimbo? And what does this say about someone who leaks private emails to third parties without permission?<br><br>
Sorry, Davie, but you're out.
</blockquote>

Paul "Call Me Miss Fieryangel":  [[You fail it]] (It = coming up with a story that any of the [[13 year old boys]] you try to pied-piper with your sexophone would see right through).
