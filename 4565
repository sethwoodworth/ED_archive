How the left hand knows [[masturbate|what the right one is doing]]. A keyboard is the device that allows people to [[shot web]] with their computer, from goading [[Stickam]] whores into a shoe on head to [[screencap]]ping your TOW vandalism before some butthurt [[sysop]] kills all the funny with a revert. It is typically utilized with one hand, although [[jameth|some]] use their [[dong]] to do the job, and occasionally two hands in tandem after theyâ€™ve finished wiping the [[semen]] off of their LCD display.

The keyboard design comes from a [[drama]]-generating tool invented back when the [[white]] man still owned black persons, known as a typewriter. People such as [[Mark Twain]] and the [[Lincoln Continental]] used this device to crudely forge their [[flame war]]s and suicide notes out of ink and dead trees. The step between paper mail and the internet was an invention known as the telegraph, the [[IRL]] precursor to [[IRC|text-only chat]] that expressed everything in primitive [[ASCII]], known as Morse.

'''Morse code''': <big>-.-- --- ..- / .- .-. . / .- / -. .. --. --. . .-. -.- .. -.- .</big>

'''Translation''': ''You are a niggerkike.''

A [[genius]] fusion of the two many years later yielded the modern day keyboard. 

Besides the standard [[QWERTY]] layout, there also exists a different design known by [[virgin]]al geeks as '''Dvorak''' and by normal people as unusable and [[retarded]]. [[Linux]] fatasses and [[CSIII]] graduates like to argue about its superior design that allows one to hammer out sob-story LJ posts at 50+ WPM over their average. While this is technically true, the vast majority of internet users are mentally incapable of learning the alphabet, making the point utterly [[moot]].

===Keyboards and Music===

Keyboard can also refer to the instrument played by the [[Keyboard Cat|least talented]] member of [[you]]r band. Some of these keyboards can plug into computers utilizing the infamous [[USB]] line, and [[Tay Zonday|when the two combine]], the end result can cause [[massive damage]] to the internet.
