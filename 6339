Penny Arcade

'''''Penny Arcade''''', also known as ''Piggy Baldcade'', is up there with some of the [http://www.vgcats.com  shittiest] [http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com/ shit] that's ever been [http://www.megatokyo.com shat].

It is a direct [[Shit|result]] of the [[basement-dweller]]s responsible feeding on the [[santorum]] of funny - the disgusting bottom slush of [[anti-lulz]] that [[noone]] in their right minds wouldn't bother to draw a comic of.

The arrogance and sheer ignorance required to subject the internets to this kind of mental vomit can be explained by the decaying filth being the ugly bastard son of witty comments on a gaming blog and the fact that it's [[animu|wenga]] drawn by [[unfunny]] geeks.

As the alleged funny in the comics is either ignored or not seen by [[mundanes]], a [[video games|specific subject]] has been chosen by the authors to furthermore point out the said [[lulz]] resulting in plenty of massive [[fail]].

[http://www.penny-arcade.com/ ''Penny Arcade''] requires you to read gaming news to understand the shit joke. "OMG TYCHO KILLED GABE FOR THE PAC MAN WATCH! SO ORIGINAL! I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN AN EARLIER COMIC!"

''Penny Arcade'' expects us to respect them because they have made as many as three funny comics over the course of five years and they give money to some charity or something about kids playing video games. Well, maybe they should be happy they don't have to play tripe like [[FF7]] and GTA3.

[[Image:Penny rape.jpg|thumb|left|One of their tamer comics. Trust me, you don't want to see the one where Gabe is shitting in Tycho's mouth.]]

==Animation==
The animation started out as something that could have been drawn by a 12 year old autistic kid wearing a football helmet, but soon evolved into animation that could be drawn by a [[13-year-old boy|13 year old autistic kid]] wearing a bike helmet.

==Assault on the Ears==
Thanks to the widespread [[slavery|freedom]] that [[podcasting]] has offered every [[douche]] with [[unwarranted self importance]], we can now have the excitement of PA's creators jacking each other off and reading [[boring]] gaming news with their [[pedo|chymo]] voices.

==The Creators==
Not since ''[[Megatokyo]]'' or [[fursona]]s have the creators of a comic so overcompensated their looks. Keep in mind that in the beginning they were never supposed to be representations of Bald and Pig-like. Only through fans assuming they were did they become the sick and twisted fantasies of the two.

Tycho is portrayed as a [[rich and beautiful|handsome]] [[grammar Nazi]]. IRL he is bald and sports B-cup [[fat|moobs]].

Gabe is portrayed as a dashing smart-ass who uses a cardboard tube as a sword. IRL he looks like an unshowered Jew scarecrow with [[GRIDS]].

As of August 8, Tycho has admitted to now wearing dentures, most likely due to [[Jack Sparrow|scurvy]]. Apparently he never learned to drink a bit of orange juice in addition to his diet of [[fat|Cheetos]] and [[Mountain Dew]].

Both have given birth to children, whom they regularly abuse and then [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2006/10/30#1162232160 take photographic evidence].

They're actually pretty decent guys when compared to the other people in the [[Shit nobody cares about|Webcomic Industry]]. But when the people you're being compared to are the likes of [[Tim Buckley]] and [[Megatokyo|Fred-chan]] you don't really have to try very hard.

==/v/ Meme==
''Penny Arcade'' [[baby|spawned]] a damn fucking wonderful [[meme]] "Why I am so bald". It simply starred Tycho being bald. <s>Everyone still loves it and it usually consists of [[faggots]] posting "bald [[photomanip|shoops]]" of ''Penny Arcade'' comics. Bald threads are coming back into style.</s> '''[[newfag|DISREGARD THAT I SUCK COCKS]]'''

=="Phorums"==
The site's forums have a long history, dating back to the original message board (termed the "phorum") users, or phags. The board is famous for its many 500 internal server errors, jail-rape, a disastrous social experiment where people posted in an unregulated board exactly as you would expect them to (cocks)and a webpocalypse brought about by calling someone's wife fat.

==PAX==

Every summer, thousands of ''Penny Arcade'' [[fgt]]s go to [[Seattle]] and [[secks|merge]] to become one massive gibbering and greasy example of how to fail at [[life]]. They call this PAX, or the [[virgin|Pussy Avoidance]] [[convention|Expo]]. This con, having replaced the presently [[penis|minuscule]] E3, is now, unfortunately, the biggest gaming con in the known universe. The largest attractions at PAX include "[[rape|dry-rape]] the two girls who [[asking for it|accidentally walked in]] the building," the Tycho/Gabe IRL [[fanfic|slash]] performance (on-stage and televised), and the mountains of pillows that, by the end of the weekend, are covered in [[smegma|gamer juices]] and smell worse than a bucket of curdled semen.

The only thing to do if your friends force you into going to this closeted [[furry]] [[gangbang]] is to [[spam]] the [[DS]] pictochat rooms with hand-drawn [[Goatse]] and [[Longcat]]. [[DESU]] spam and declaring the pictochat to be [[Habbo /B/lockade|closed due to AIDS]] is also [[popular]]. [[Lulz]] can be had watching the miserable 90-pound [[nerds]] discussing their Samus Aran rape fantasies threaten to "[[internet tough guy|close YOUR pool]]" over a hand-held game device, as the spam floods freely and [[Anonymous|anonymously]].






















==Penny Arcade: Furry Sympathizers==

When the [[holocaust|Furocaust]] comes, ''Penny Arcade'' will no doubt try to safe-harbor the cockroaches. [http://www.penny-arcade.com/2007/07/06 First line's the proof.] [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/07/06 And the comic.]

==Food Controversy==

In October a controversial comic was posted in which Baldy spoke out against a new brand of snack for gamers. The comic can be viewed here: http://penny-arcade.com/images/2008/20081003.jpg 

This was widely disregarded since its obvious from photographic evidence that he will eat anything.

==Raped by dickwolves!==

[[Image:Penny Arcade rape comic.jpg|thumb|left|The horror!]]
[[Image:Gaberapeculture.png|thumb|left|Rape is fucking hilarious!]]
On August 11, 2010 Penny Arcade made a strip in which an imaginary person was [[raped]] [[IRL|imaginarily]] by a [[otherkin|mythological creature]] whose every limb was an erect [[phallus]].  This caused a mild shitstorm, which was later elevated when a followup comic was released and Gabe compared rape victims to fruit. The resulting drama is probably the only amusing thing to ever happen as a result of Penny Arcade's existence.  See: http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2010/08/survivors-are-so-sensitive.html

Soon after they didn't pay much attention to the issue and even created merchandise off it. This sparked an all out drama bomb of destruction across the internet. In the given light of the scenario the creators of PA looked even worse every time they tried to joke more on the resulting situation. Eventually they caved in and took the merchandise down. Fans were still pissed at them despite the take down and more drama ensued. The drama that has ensued from this entire event has even forced companies and speakers to back out of PAX East 2011. Mike doesn't seem to give a shit since they're still getting paid and will proudly wear his shitty shirt during the convention.
