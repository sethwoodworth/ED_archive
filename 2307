'''Im 18, do i have potential?? ''' was the title of a thread posted on [http://forum.bodybuilding.com Bodybuilding.com] on October 30th, [[2005]]. The thread was posted by an 18 year old going by the username '''badboy2''' (real name, '''Marcus Graham'''), with simply the thread title and a lulzy picture. The general consensus of the rest of the juicemonkey forumers was that he looks like a serial killer, so they did the greatest bit of trolling that they could think of and have been [[photoshop]]ping his picture for over 4 years. [[Some argue]] that this has turned into one of the most [[epic thread]]s on the internet to date.

==LULZFLASH: POTENTIAL REVEALED==
As it turns out, this Sydney-based [[serial killer]] did have potential. As early as [[last thursday]], badboy's guido powers activated sending him into the throws of guido-puberty, granting him the gifts of a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMOh-cul6M new haircut] and a 10 inch [[cock]]. Little more than two years later, Graham could be seen [http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=2064191 banging the hot poon and flexing his highly ripped guidobody in various locker rooms with other homosexuals].
