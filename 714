Avoidance
An [[IRL]] phenomenon where having far more important things to be getting on with causes a person to check their email a lot, [[blog]], read [[TOW|a lot of shit]] [[Shit nobody cares about|they couldn't care less about]], and produce short, poorly-thought-out stubs on [[wiki]]s based on what they've stumbled into on [[4chan|the web]].

And also to burn their dinner... dammit!
