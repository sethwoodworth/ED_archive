According to [[white people]], the '''Race Card''' is a foolproof way for [[niggers]] to [[OJ Simpson|get away with anything]]. It is a well known [[fact]] that EVERY time a [[whitey]] doesn't like a [[black]] it is due to racism, and the insult will never be forgotten.

According to [[black]] people, the '''Race Card''' is a tactic used by honkies to get away (not unlike Robert Blake) with being racist by crying like [[butthurt]] [[faggot]]s about "reverse racism" and "discrimination against whites by black people going unpunished" until everyone gets sick of them crying and drops the subject so they will [[STFU]]. 

The race card is a low blow and instead of being a last resort, the niggers whip it out at the first sign of oppression. Whether this oppression being in the form of saying that a black person stole a whitey's watermelon or to a simple hate crime.

== The Technique ==
When a black person is accused of something, or just wants some attention, he or she will play the race card, which basically means declaring their enemy a [[racist]] without any shred of proof or evidence whatsoever that there is racism involved. Naturally, it works in every case because if a black man calls a white man a racist, the aforementioned white man will be despised, scolded, beaten, dragged, [[lynching|lynched]], tarred, feathered, and set on fire.

[[Don Imus]], [[Duane Chapman|Dog the Bounty Hunter]] and Mark Fuhrman from the [[OJ Simpson]] case all learned the power of the almighty race card the hard way.

It is also used by Whites as a way of scaring other Whites by reminding them of a Black person in a position of power's insufferable, scary blackness such as the connection between [[Obama]] and Rev. Wright or a White politician having a black lovechild.  Whites can also preemptively use the accusation of playing the race card to make rampant [[faggotry|bigotry]] A-OK, as in, 'Will you endorse my calling you a lazy nigger, or are you gonna play the Race Card?'

== Examples ==
* [[O.J. Simpson]]
* Cynthia McKinney
* Rodney King
* [[Habbo Raid]]
* [[Barack Obama]]
* [[Hillary Clinton]]
