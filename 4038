Insane Clown Posse/TL;DR
In order to properly warn you about the effects of freebasing Preparation H, we must turn to the rantings of fans of [[Insane Clown Posse]], known as '[[Juggalos]]' and '[[Juggalos|Juggalettes]]'...
Remember that all of these people suffer from ICP-Tardism, so laugh at them freely!

First of all, I'm a Juggalette and I couldn't tell you guys why people have to be such haters. I don't understand why these people have to be like this, [[Butthurt|just because their own pathetic lives suck, and they want to make fun of the Juggalo's and Juggalette's.]]	 
Well I'm really sorry that these people have to take it out on us. Yeah, we're different and chances are half of us were outcasts and we finally found a place to fit in, and it's a place where we're actually accepted. 	 
The funny part about this whole thing was "Juggalo's are stoner's" and "Since we don't want to waste our time getting to know Juggalo's . . ." That tells you right there that these people have no idea what they're talking about. Yeah they're just trying to piss us off and see what we're going to spit back in their faces. Why would we waste our time right? Most of society hates us and we're looked down upon, but atleast we got friends closer than they'll ever have or dream of. We have friends to fall back on who are always there and we can always count on them, what do these people have? Nothing.	 
It almost makes you feel bad for the people that have to write all this hate stuff. They do it because they don't fit in anywhere and have nothing better to do then make fun of people who seem like a 'lower' class then them, yes some of us truely are scrubs, but some of us are actually pretty rich. Any Juggalo would know this, I mean have you listened to or seen the video for :Let's Go All The Way:? Right there is proof. Here's some quotes for you straight from Behind The Paint. 	 

"A scrub is a scrub. There is just something off about us scrubs that makes other people not like us. There is just something different about some of us, whether poor or rich, white or black, fat or skinny, boy or girl, that makers other people pissed. We're clowns for the rest of the world to fuck with! Scrubs! Clowns! Call it a curse that we're bron with or call it a blessing. The bottom line is, a scrub is a scrub, whether they like it or not. I love the fact that I'm a scrub and I love my scrubby ass friends." 	 
"You can ask yourself 'Why is ICP so hated?' all day long, but I'll tell you why. It's because when you look behind ICP, you'll find two geeky scrubs rapping and a geeky ass scrub manager!"	 
"So if everyone hates ICP, who's buying all the records? Motherfuckin', original ass, down home, straight up SCRUBS. That's who! Ninja's that can relate! Even if they have a little bit of scrub in them, they can still relate. Ninja's from all walks of life that have scrub in them."	 
"The only people that truely cannot stand ICP are the people who cannot relate to us in any kind of way. Fuck them anyway."

Violent J is an amazing writer and he's right. You may hate ICP but the Juggalo's and Juggalette's will either blow you off or straight up say 'FUCK YOU!' Maybe even drop the short line from Homies 'You don't like it you can FUCK OFF!'	 
		 
Better yet straight from a song that I'm postive every Juggalo or Juggalette knows, Juggalo Family, "Say what you will of me I'll always have Juggalo Family". So go ahead show hate but read that again and realize we probably don't care about it. My last qoute from a song: "Me and my homies stay tight like a noose, and if you step to one of us you better step to the whole crew. I never knew that I could depend, that I could have some friends who's down til the very end."	 
		 
To set things straight, Juggalo's and Juggalette's don't think the most important thing in the world is to listen to ICP. I mean come on how many people are actually proud of who they are? Apparently not the people who wrote the hate messages, they knew it would start conflict. Don't be pissed if the Juggalo Family is more close then you and your own pathetic family, sorry it's probably true. We get along better then you and your own blood family, and we probably relate better then you and your own family. That's just how it is. Sorry to bust your bubble but we don't care what you think of us. All I'm doing right now is setting things straight for you stupid and ignorant people. We're different we accept it, and we're proud to be what we are. 	 
		 
If any of you haters got a problem with this feel free to take straight to me. Here's my Email address for you too: liltwiztidsammi@netscape.net and if you really want to harass me here's my yahoo and aim screen name. Yahoo: juggalette_whoopwhoop Aim: [[Barely legal|liltwiztidsammi]]	 
You can even check out my myspace and send me hate mail through there. www.myspace.com/lil_juggalette17	 
I want you to go ahead it's pure temptation. You're nothing but a scared little bitch if you don't. That or you just don't want to 'waste your time' trying to come up with something good to say to me.	 
		 
Much Wicked Clown Love to the Juggalo's and Juggalette's that read this.

The Dark Carnival. . .
			
Many think that the Carnival is a cult, but this is a fallacy. We have to pay no money to believe in the Carnival, and we see no human being as a God or higher power. The Carnival is here to bring people together. The lost, the wicked, and the holy, all together for the same fight for God. We have been around since 1992, and we have enough followers to match the population of Washington, and yet we have no government recognition, but that fight is being fought every day. The word for one who has faith in the Dark Carnival or listens to any Psychopathic Records artist is a Juggalo.

We have with stood many years of torment misunderstanding and hate from the general population, for looking like people who would hate. Can someone explain this to me please? I have grown to expect this, though. I am writing this today to try and minimize that misunderstanding.
			
They wanted to keep the initials of the gang to show that their tenacity and that they weren’t going to quit, but they also wanted to change the name to show that they no longer wanted to be affiliated with gang life any more. J suggested the name ‘Insane Clown Posse’ based on a series of dreams he had been having the preceding couple of weeks. The dreams depicted a crazy clown in black and what face paint and a pink and blue jesters hat running through their city and knifing down wicked people. The band loved it and the name was official.
 		
That night after the band meeting J drove home. In his apartment he would experience something that would change the rest of his life. As he was listening to music, he suddenly got a rush of adrenalin, he was scared. He turned to see what looked to him like the jet black outline of the clown in his dreams. He was not able to later recall what happened, but he was out, he then had a vision, it wasn’t a dream because it was too vivid. He was falling from the night sky, and as he looked down he saw a great caravan of freaks and jugglers and the dead. He saw the clown leading the caravan, it was the one from his dreams. It stopped and looked at him. It seemed to be trying to say something, but J could not here him. Then the Clown drew a deck of cards out of his pockets, and one by one let them go to descend to the dirt. J heard the words ‘After all six have fallen, the end of time will consume us all’.
J woke up to his radio, once quiet was now all the way up. He turned it down, his girlfriend yelled at him, he didn’t say anything about the dream to her. But his friends became believers the next day and still are to this day.
			
The Dark Carnival is a supernatural Earthbound force. Eternally it roams collecting and judging the dead souls, and taking them to their final destination. It is what spreads he word of God eternally, so if anyone had told you of God or Jesus, it was by the will of the Carnival. It is called the Carnival because that is the way it adapted, it has become a great circus-like force because of the way it has been set up by God and the people who have been called to it. It also sets a bound for acceptance to all you would have to enhibit to be a part. Holy or evil, those who would turn away from strange ideas are not the type of people needed and sought out by the Carnival.

The Carnival has not always been around, it is fairly recent. It was creation, made for the purpose of the end of the world. Armageddon is believed to Juggalos to be coming very soon, now that the six have fallen, we are in a calm, and the Storm (the Tempest) is soon to come. The Carnival is the force that will destroy Hell and Earth to make way for a more perfect world, but that presents a problem In such dark times there are many more in hell than will be fighting them, and the Carnival acts as sort of a draft for this war of good versus evil. Those who will fight are those who were lost from the word of God, or those who were full of hate and sin, who were then saved and made faithful. They were the perfect candidates, they were Juggalos.
			
The Juggalo interoperation of death is that you die, and then the Carnival picks you up, you then are tested by the Joker’s Card’s and if you pass the test, you move on to Shangri-La, and if you don’t, you’re about to get mad hot. If you are a Juggalo, you stay with the Carnival to pick up other souls and await the Tempest. Those that pass over can still watch the living, it is believed that the dead watch us through eyes of crows and other birds.
The Joker’s Cards are the representation of the Carnival’s judgment of our lives and the weight of our sins. They each have a different impact on each life and their independent opinion is as important as the group together, because if you don’t pass even one of their tests then you go to Hell. The responsibility of each card goes as followed.

The Carnival of Carnage doesn’t act as a judgment card as much as a flag holder. A representation of the goal of Shangri-La. The term ‘Joker’s Card’ refers to this being, for it is the one who introduced the cards to Joseph Bruce.
 		 
The Ringmaster is the eater of your sins. The more sins you commit and do not repent for, he grows larger. At the end of your life the Carnival will issue you a dagger that represents your good deeds, and you will have to combat this monster. Win or lose, it is up to you now.
 		 
The Riddlebox is a stationary being kept at the bottom of a wagon of the Carnival’s caravan, you are brought to the top of this wagon and pushed on a spiral slide all the way down. At the bottom you are greeted by the third jokers card, concealed within his box like a turtle. You walk up to the box and embrace your fears, as you turn the crank on the side of the box. If you led a hate free life then you will be greeted by the Riddlebox, and descend to your next task. But if you have not, a trap door beneath you will open and you will be sent to Hell.
 		 
The Great Melinko is under the title of Necromaster. He can read thoughts, and if your thoughts are wicked, he will know. If you have wicked thoughts the bird that he carries will tell him the opinion of those passed on to Shangri-La, and he will use his wand to send you where you need to go.
 		 
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, Jake and Jack. Brothers born in flame they are in constant war. They represent your soul. Jake is your love and compassion, eternally juggling your sins. Jack is your hatred and bigotry, trying to add to your sins so that the flame of them will grow too large and Jake may fumble them. If he does then your path to Shangri-La will be lost. The 3 balls of fire are focused on greed and lies.
 		 
The Wraith is not by definition a card, it does not influence or judge your life, all it does is take you to your tests and to your final destination. The Wraith is the only subject of the Carnival that has been around for all time, collecting all souls and finding his way into all sides of common mythology and tales. Depicted with a bible, the Wraith is a very Christian being. If you are Christian you will recall the connection between the crow carried by the Wraith to communicate with the Heavens, and the portion of the bible narrating the time in which Christ was dying on the cross: the sinner beside him on his crucifix had his eyes plucked out by a crow.

The Wraith, like the dead, sees through the eyes of crows, so that he may sore above and move quickly. He is unlike the Devil and God, and he is Earthbound, for that reason, he is considered a part of the carnival.
 		 
The order of the cards are reversed from the way they were introduced. Since the 6 on the featured Joker’s card was backwards, the order is said to be backwards also. First you die and are taken by the Wraith to the amazing Jeckel Brothers, and then to Melinko, etc.. It makes more sense to me, but like the rest of this religion it is a subject of faith and interpretation, as a result of the youth and un-organization of the religion.
 		 
But however, the Carnival has brought me great faith in a lot of ways, and I am so grateful to it. I am going to finish this up with this: You can accept it or reject it, believe it or not, and the truth is always going to be out there somewhere. The Carnival isn’t for every one, I am merely planting the seed. It is up to you to let it grow.
