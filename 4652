Krisez
{{watch}}
Krisez is an Australian photographer found in Sydney. You can usually find him at cosplay conventions with two or three cameras, because as we all know you obviously need more then one camera to be a real photographer. Overcompensation is lovely, it really helps to pick up younger girls.

==The 'man'==

Now, look at this. Seriously, look at it. It's hard to believe someone with a 10year old's hair cut that happens to be 39 years of age can get a girlfriend right? Well miraculously, he has one. But apparently one is  not enough. Like his cameras he needs two or more at all times. The seemingly innocent flirt, actually has tendencies to take it too far and then some. It's well known fact that he likes to fuck around with younger girls. Younger TAKEN girls. It makes him feel good, like a bully child with low self esteem, it makes him feel like the alpha male he wishes he was to have young taken girls get caught up in his mind games, so he can get in their pants, fuck around for a while and then return home to his girlfriend and fuck them both together.

==Photography==
Surprisingly, he's a half decent photographer. That is outside of cosplay of course. Inside of cosplay, he takes quick snapshots, sticks a huge fuckoff 'watermark' on them, edits nothing and uploads them basically as raw images. The less work he has to do the better, after all, he's only photographing cosplayers as a means to get closer to them, pick out the fat ones. 

At a recent convention he stated 'pick your online name so when people Google search you they only find you'. Now, if you Google image search Krisez you'll find more about his private life then you're expecting [as well as a whole bunch of messed up images].

==The victims==

His most famous victim [and potentially the most hated dude on this earth by the girlfriend] Kat. Young and bisexual, Kat had a somewhat hairy and rather butch girlfriend when Krisez started on him. He pried the happy couple apart and had his fun with Kat's body and mind. He would spend all the time he could with Kat. Photograph him, Made him believe that he idolized him. Even did a 'rape' shoot with him, which one samefag suspects more then photographing took place. Eventually when Kris outgrew her, he just left her, with less friends, no girlfriend, nothing. She then fell into a suicidal spiral of depression she hasn't coming back out from, convinced he still loves her no matter what support she receives. Friends are patiently waiting for the day that she realizes he NEVER loved her. Only then can she let go and move on. His latest victim seems to be Bec. She was with him almost all of Animania, and witness reports say that she was sending Krisez sexually explicit messages while ignoring all messages from her EX-boyfriend. (He found this out by logging all her chats and reading her phone messages that dog)

There have been MANY MANY more, Some girls have been lucky enough to see right through him.

==Facebook==
He claims he doesn't have one, but there's rumours that he uses an alias for his facebook stalking needs. (Artemis Drakagh (I MEAN SERIOUSLY????)) Congratulations, use a fake name for FACEBOOK, and you're known alias to buy sex toys. You deserve a medal.

==Special talent or greedy troll?== 
It seems krisez has managed to perfect one thing every deviantart artist dreams about - boosting page views. He has apparently told a few people how to do it but nobody is going to say yet. But surprisingly, he doesn't seem to boost his own, just any person he watches that mentions kiriban. Could it be he's over compensating for something by taking almost every kiriban he knows about, or can it be that he just can't allow someone else to get something better then him.
