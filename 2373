{{quote|Someone sends me the links every time there's a new one...many times the lines are so funny, I [[LOL|laugh out loud]], and I’m laughing about the scene that I staged myself! You couldn't get a better compliment as a director [...] I think it's only fair if now it's taken as part of our history, and used for [[lulz|whatever purposes people like]]|''Downfall'' director Oliver Hirschbiegel|...yeah tell that to your jew producers ([http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Downfall-Director-Thinks-The-Hitler-Meme-Is-Hilarious-16592.html sauce])}}

'''Downfall''' (aka "Hitler meme", "Hitler freaks") is basically a [[old meme|played-out]] YouTube [[meme]] you're probably more than a little sick of by now, in which the bunker scene from the [[movie]] ''Downfall'' (''[[moonspeak|Der Untergang]]'') is [[stolen|remixed]] with [[meh|humorous]] subtitles.  

Although they've been around a few years, new variations still [[erection|pop up]] now and then. The whole thing seems to have transcended - to have passed out of the other side of [[fail]] and [[forced meme]] to a kind of superposition. One could even postulate a theory of [[Large Hadron Collider|quantum lulz]] whereby in some universe, every possible topic of conversation, politics, philosophy, sexual deviance and vidya gaming has had a Downfall video made about it.

One can see, therefore, that all Downfall videos exist in potentia, as waveform. Unfortunately, the act of observing the results does not make them funny.

Still, if [[you]] have some basic [[WMM|wmm]] skills, feel like typing out [[text]] for 5 hours and have no fucking life, give it your best shot.

'''This Just In''', Constantin Films; the company that ''owns'' the rights to the film, threw out another round of lolsuits.  YouTube, [[bureaucratic fuck|as always]], complied.

Seriously, there's fucking hundreds of these on the [[tubes]].  Well, there were a lot more until the German production company decided to get fucking [[DMCA]] happy.  Anyways, here's just a select few...
