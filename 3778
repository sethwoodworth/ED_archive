Housepets!
[[Image:Housepets! typical.png|thumb|Typical Strip of Housepets!]]
'''Housepets!''' is accepted among [[furfags]] as the new best furry [[webcomic]] around since [[DC Simpson|Ozy and Millie]]. As such, it is still complete [[shit]]. Proving that nothing furry can remain innocent, even at the behest and hard work of "Housepets!" creator Rick Griffin (btw, his [[fursona]] is a [[lolwut|furret]]), the comic has become fodder for [[Rule 34]]. Recently, the comic jumped shark when Rick decided to infuse his comic with scifi/fantasy [[shit|mumbo jumbo]] that no one understands. Even [[13 year old boys|hardcore fans]] are concerned that their [[yiff|innocent]], [[unfunny|uproariously hilarious]] comic has gone down the shitter.

==Characters==
* [[Retard|Peanut Butter]] - A [[faggot]] [[dog]] who belongs to the [[vore|Sandwich]] family along with his [[incest|sister he wants to fuck]] who, by the way, [[A cat is fine too|is a cat]].
* [[Reverse trap|Grape Jelly]] - A [[cat]] who is Peanut's fuck-buddy.  She likes to [[OJ Simpson|solve her problems with violence]].  Also everyone thought she was a boy.
* [[Wigger|Bino]] - A dog who runs the [[Gang|Good ol' dogs club]] that causes all the mischief.  He has a much cooler brother.  Is also a [[retard]]
* black person - A faggot cat who is in love with Grape.  Is a pretty cool guy, has a bite in his ear and doesn't afraid of doing nothing in the comic.
[[Image:Ball_of_yarn.jpg|thumb|If you wear this you're guaranteed to have friends.]]
* black person - A niggerdog.  While not eating [[fried chicken]] he likes to [[Rape|choke small animals]].  He is in the gang and his owner is a nigra.
* Fox - Another fucking dog who's fuck buddy [[irony|is the guy who tried to kidnap him]].  Also apparently he's [[retard|retard]]smart.
* King - [[WTF|A PETA member who stole Fox and then was being charged in the courthouse when a giant gryphon came out of no where and turned him into a dog and now his butt buddy is the same dog he tried to kidnap.]] Fantards immediately loved King because he was an asshole. Also, Housepets! fans have [[Transformation|Transformation Fetishes]].
* [[Aspie|Sasha]] - Somehow more retarded than Peanut.  She has an owner who drinks and rapes her, then locks her out of the house forcing King to [[Fuck|cuddle with]] her.
* [[Fursuit|Joey]] - A dog who wishes he was a cat so much that he [[furfag|dresses up like one]].
* Fido - A K9 cop that is Bino's cooler brother and co-founder of the gang.  Has an interracial relationship with a black person cat Sabrina.
* black person - A cat that is Fido's [[mexican|illegal]] black person girlfriend.
* [[Batshit insane|Tarot]] - Peanuts [[batshit insane]], Pomeranian [[fuck buddy|girlfriend]].  Turns out she was an [[Africa|Egyptian]] [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|Dragon]]. And she's playing an intergalactic D&D game with a [[2 gryphon|gryphon named Pete]] and a [[Naruto|Nine Tailed Kitsune]]. What?
* [[Mario|Daisy]] - HI I'M DAISY!
* Spot - A dog superhero comic drawn and written by Peanut. Always used as filler when Rick is too [[meth|preoccupied]] to draw a real comic.
[[Image:Tiger awesome.gif|thumb|Tiger is pretty [[awesome]]]]
[[Image:Spot Super dog.png|thumb|WTF is this shit! An ''aspie'' could draw better than this]]
* [[Cat|Tiger]] - A dog who is named after a cat.  Is teased because of it. 
* Marvin -  Tiger's [[fuck buddy|bro]].  He is also a cat.
* Zach - A rabbit [[WTF|who is the catalyst of a cosmic chain reaction by opening the forbidden gate in the Mysterious Forest]].

There are also some humans but Rick decided to rip off [[shit|Peanuts]] and ignore humans in favor of the more [[boring|interesting]] lives of the titular Housepets. Seriously, Mr. Sandwich's beard is more interesting than half of the comics.


==The Penis Saga==
Since the comic itself is so fucking boring, some people have decided to add penises to the comics in an attempt to spice them up:

This has ushered the age of the Great Penis Saga where people put penises on there favorite strips thus making the comic easier to read and a hell of a lot funnier.

[[You]] too can contribute too this greatness by adding penises to your favorite strip until every character in every strip of Housepets! has a penis. This also works for females just giv'em nips and vags. And penises.
