'''[[wikipedia:wikipedia:Requests for adminship|Requests for adminship]]''', ("[[Wikipedese|WP:RFA]]") is a page on Wikipedia where [[you]] too can become a basement-dwelling [[administrator]]. When requesting to level up, be sure you have enough experience points.

==What happens==
Typically, a user [[Masturbate|nominates themselves]] or [[fellatio|sucks a current admin's cock]] for a nomination. Any wannabe who runs this gauntlet will get raped and abused in every way imaginable. [[Assrape|Every single cavity is probed]]. This goes on for seven days, which is known as "Hell Week" among the Wikipedos, however some chicken out before this. If the newfag survives this then they are promoted to Sysop for the further pleasure of the Wikipedophiles. Some sick fucks enjoy this, however most end up scarred for life. As such, RfA is a good trolling tactic for harassing your enemies while maintaining the appearance of being amicable.


RfA is typically a battle ground where users fight over who gets to have high power users in their guild. Perennial discussion topics on the talk page include crying a river over the fact that the pool of Wikipedos are getting more and more infested with AIDS causing editors and admins to quit, and screaming that the world will end because there are no newfags on the chopping block, and sacrificing babies in [[Grawp|Satan's name]] to prevent this from happening. As this is a popular meme on the RfA page, one can improve their chances by running when it is empty.

At the end of a RfA, a bureaucratic fuck judges if the user is pleasureful enough to promote to an admin. Sometimes, a full tribunal is held. If the user has been raped more than 80 times, the RfA will most likely pass. Generally, if the user was gangbanged 70-80 times the RfA will pass, however if it is around 70 the bureaucratic fuck must use their discretion, by taking them out for a spin themselves. This standard has changed over time, and got lower over the years.

==A typical RfA==
===Support===
*'''Support''' All of the below

===Oppose===
All of the below do not matter at all. In fact, fuck the rules! YOU'RE ALL ADMINS!
*'''Oppose''' [[DougsTech|Too many admins currently]].
*'''Oppose''' Does not meet [[USI|my criteria]]. User has only 3999 edits. I would like to see at least 4000.
*'''Oppose''' [[I_did_it_for_the_lulz|I view self-noms as prima facie evidence of power hunger.]]
*'''Oppose''' Offensive user box.
*'''Oppose''' Per answer to Question #69.

==Requests for Bureaucratship (RfB)==
Hosted on the same page is a page where users can become "Bureaucrats" [sic]. 'Nuff said. It is harder to pass, and users who pass get to decide the outcomes of RfAs as shown above.

==Notable enemies of the state==
Every now and then, a user makes votes with logic too advanced for the TOW users. This leads to conflict between the users who want to censor them and those who defend their freedom of speech, sparking much butthurt, votes for banning, etc.

*{{wpul|Kmweber}} was a user who added the vote <code>'''Oppose''' &mdash; I view self-noms as ''prima facie'' evidence of power hunger.</code> to every self nom. This impeccable logic sparked the rage and bullying of the TOW admins. Kmweber was driven off but eventually came back. 
*{{wpul|DougsTech}} was a user who spammed <code>'''Oppose''' &mdash; Too many admins lately</code> on every single RfA. See the [[DougsTech|ED page]] for more details.
*{{wpul|Keepscases}} was a troll who opposed every atheist for displaying "offensive userboxes" on their page.

==The Plan==
#[[Huggle|Revert vandalism]]
#Join [[IRC|#wikipedia]]
#Suck teh admin [[cock]]
#[[????]]
#[[Profit!]]

==Tips==
[[At least 100]] RfA's fail per year because of personal vendettas and the inherent risk of an [[eBay]] sale.  Also, getting in a argument with someone pretty much guarantees that they'll pop in your RfA with and [[NO U|make an oppose vote]].  So when working towards a [[sock]] admin account, [[divide by zero|one must not make enemies]].

==Infamous RFAs==
*TL;DR
*[[Angela]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Angela wut]

*[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Chzz|Chzz]] is a user who ''almost'' passed despite suspicions that he had been using sock puppets, however in what was probably the most stupid move a Wikipedo could make, [[Fail|he edited his own RfA using an abusive sock he had been using]]. His RfA immediately tanked, even his nominator withdrew his support. Chzz's sock was blocked, but Chzz was allowed to continue editing.  We missed out on all the lulz he would have made if this sock wielding wikipedo did become an admin. See Pastor Theo and Law below.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Enigmaman_2 Enigmaman 2] This [[wikipedo]] decided to [[vandalism|vandalise]] whilst not logging in. Unfortunately for him [[Bureaucratic Fuck]] [[wikipedia:user:deskana|Deskana]] [[raep|check user'd his IP]]. This resulted in much [[lulz]] and [[drama]].
:[[PROTIP]]: Next time use a proxy.

*[[Wikipedia:User:FlyingToaster|Flying Toaster]] declared she wrote [[over 9000|more than 150 articles]]. After a [[win|successful]] RFA another [[wikipedo]] found out all the articles were cunt pasted from websites.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Dihydrogen_Monoxide_3&oldid=216942444 Giggy formerly known as Dihydrogen Monoxide] got an unprecedented [[over 9000|300 support votes]] yet he [[wikicide|withdrew]] after the nominator got [[butthurt]]. The user felt so much butthurt he decided to [[lol|change his name and blank his RFA]].

*[[Wikipedia:User:Senator Palpatine|Senator Palpatine]] is someone who failed epically at the aforementioned plan.

*[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Pastor_Theo|Pastor Theo]] was a sock of the banned user Ecoleetage and passed RfA, presumably because Pastors and TOW admins [[pedophile|have common ground on Wikipedia]]. Pastor Theo used another sock account [[Wikipedia:User:Mrs. Wolpoff]] to [[lulz|abusively win AfD debates]]. This was uncovered by a sock check on the former account, leading to the desysop and blocking of the account. See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&diff=313992740&oldid=313674007 Arbcom statement].

*[[Wikipedia:User:Law|Law]] was successfully nominated for RfA by [[Wikipedia:User:GlassCobra|GlassCobra]]. However, it was discovered that Law was actually [[Wikipedia:User:The Undertow|The Undertow]], a banned ex-admin; GlassCobra later acknowledged he was aware of the sock account when he put the RfA forward. Law was promptly blocked while GlassCobra had his tools ripped out for being the first admin to knowingly nominate a sockpuppet for adminship; however, GlassCobra's adminship was restored four months later following a direct appeal to Arbcom. [[LaraLove]] also had her admin rights yanked for helping her BFF Law win RfA.  

*[[Wikipedia:User:Wiki_Greek_Basketball|Wiki Greek Basketball]] an editor with over 35,000 edits and over 100 created articles managed an epic troll of the ANI boards in retaliation of his failed RfA - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wiki_Greek_Basketball Wiki Greek Basketball's RfA]. The 17-year-old admin [[Wikipedia:User:Coffee|Coffee]] apparently made the mistake of pissing him off at his RfA. What ensued was an epic hall of fame troll of the ANI board which began here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=333965198#User:Wiki_Greek_Basketball Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents User:Wiki Greek Basketball] and grew so big that they had to give him his own pages to troll [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents/Wiki_Greek_Basketball Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Wiki Greek Basketball], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bwilkins/WGB User:Bwilkins/WGB].
