'''Lemmings''' are creatures that follow each other until death does them part. Lemmings follow their fearless leader anywhere and everywhere. Through rain, sleet, and snow, lemmings will follow. Lemmings place all their faith and trust into their leader. [[French|All for one, and one for all]] is the lemming way. Unfortunately, the fearless leader is generally poor and [[Retard|lacks knowledge and common sense]]. These naive leaders may led their followers to their deaths, usually via a cliff. Lemmings are often the subjects of video games and political cartoons.

'''Lemmings''' is a series of games portraying lemmings. These games were released for the [[Amiga]] and [[DOS]] operating systems and are known for exceeding the standards for games of that age. The lemmings in ''Lemmings'' are [[anthropomorphic|bipedal]] creatures with [[anime|green hair]] and [[Democrat|blue clothing]]. The goal of the game is to bring all of the lemmings to the exit without any of them dying.

===Skills===
In order to sent all the lemmings to the exit safety, the player must use [[List of sex moves|various skills]]. The original game had eight skills. These skills include:

{{Squote|1=I used to play multiplayer Lemmings with my sister on the SNES. She didn't really play games all that much, though she did help me beat Bubbleman in Megaman 2. Anyway, we never really cared about winning, but would just build bridges to nowhere and watch our lemmings die. Of course, then she went to college. I remember we both cried so hard that time. That was a while ago, but I still miss her being around.|2=[[Anonymous]]|3=[http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=21679438&x=more+brosvidya+stories#21682942]}}

Due to its age and poor graphics, ''Lemmings'' are often mentioned within [[Nostalgia Thread|Nostalgia threads]]. Like anything else mentioned in a nostalgia thread, ''Lemmings'' is treated as a vintage of fine wine. Knowledge of this game shows that one is a connoisseur of the fine facets of the [[1990s|90s]].

Certain humans display lemming-like characteristics. They follow the crowd and do whatever their peers tell them so. In fact, a common idiom used to argue to conformers is ''"If someone told you to jump off a cliff, would you?"'' Lemmings dress the same, talk the same, and listen to the same music. Bloggers generally use "lemming" as an insult to people that don't conform to their own beliefs. [[Linux]] supporters call [[Micro$oft]] fans "lemmings", and vice versa. [[Republicans]] call [[Obama]]'s followers "lemmings", and [[Democrats]] call [[Reagan]] worshipers "lemmings" as well. 

[[4chan]] is a magnet for a class of lemmings called [[Newfags]]. These lemmings overuse [[memes]] and post [[unoriginal]] [[image macros]] in order to be accepted by the rest of the [[Anonymous]] collective, and they usually [[fail]]. Lemmings such as those are often blamed for memes lasting for years instead of weeks, and for the last of [[OC]]. Scientists has recently discovered lemmings to be a major cause for [[Cancer|Internet cancer]].
