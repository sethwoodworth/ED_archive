{{quote|Drama free is the way to be :")|[[Foreshadowing|Oh ye of little faith, Dahvie...]]}}

It's pretty hard to stand out as a [[Scene|Scenefag]], [[rape|rapist]], [[pedo]] [[fucktard]] in the [[Crunkcore]] world, being that all the members of every band are, well, [[Hurr|that]]. But, for '''Dahvie Vanity''', the creator and consistently [[ronery|ONLY]] actual member of his band '''Blood on the Dance Floor''', he's boiled it down to a finely-tuned drama machine of ''[[You|Haterz]] vs. [[Scenewhore|Familiez]]'', all the while distracting any of the public that cares from the fact he's a Scenester [[Michael Jackson]]. [[Cool Story Bro|There is something to be said]] about a [[midget]] who can manipulate hoards of pre-teen girls to do his bidding and be his whores, but unlike cool people like a pimp, a human trafficker, or [[Tom Cruise]], this queer-bait gets his loli by making fag-tastic music with [http://twitter.com/JayyVonMonroe Jay Von Monroe] and <s>[[Jeffree Star]]</s> [[BAW|they're currently in a catfight]], and creates his drama by blaming all of his problems on his ex-bandmates. And he would've gotten away with all of it, too, if [[Jessi Slaughter|one particular loli]] could've kept her whore mouth shut.

==Get to know the travesty that is BOTDF==
[[File:Dahvie_You_Gonna_Get_Raped.jpg|150px|thumb|left|He's [[Rape|raping]] you with his eyes]]
Imagine every single thing horrible about music today, combine it with pedophilia, scenefags with tons of hair-dye and makeup, and you've got something so horribly awful that unseeing/unhearing it is not enough.

[http://twitter.com/botdfmusic  Dahvie Vanity], aka Mexican, and a host of other aliases (he changes his name constantly, because he's a [[Illegal|pedo spic]]), started his career as a 20-something [[faggot|beauty-school]] [[retard|drop-out]] from [[Florida]] back in [[2006]], he quickly realized his true passion in life: [[Michael Jackson|making shitty pop music and molesting lots and lots of children]]. And thus, '''Blood on the Dance Floor''' was born. 

Between constantly cheating on his legal [[Scenewhore|girlfriends]] with jailbait/loli/[[trap|etc.]] on his tours, bragging about said lays, and wearing a wig and wimminz clothing (because everyone knows that the best way to prove you're straight is by dressing in [[transvestite|drag]]), he is also a hairdresser and a [[pedophile]], and 100% [[not gay]]. Oh, and makes shit music, or something. His favorite way to prove he's not gay is by [[rape|kiddie-diddling]]. He is almost 30, but tells people he's in his early 20s because he's still [[Gary Glitter|totally a child at heart, guis]].

Right now, his token gaymate is [http://twitter.com/JayyVonMonroe Jay Von Monroe] who claims to be a [[model]]. It is also known that the members of the band are all [[Jeffree Star|fags]] with [[Trap|sexual identity crisis]] and spent most of their time [[I CAME|jizzing]] into the anal passages of many Japanese and Philippino Lady-boys. Once those trannies could no longer sate their lust for tight assholes, they picked up [[loli|little girls]], usually from the Internets, because of their sexual ambiguity and [[Emo|lack of good parenting that would prevent them from being such retards]]. [[Albino|Garrett]] [[Ecstasy]] left shortly after a major blowout over Dahvie's multiple sex offenses; he's been doing solo projects, but for the most part has been under the radar due to Dahvie's fantards all but permanently destroying his already short-lived "career." They traded some barbs via shit music, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7JVLF1O7kE Garrett going the somewhat-bearable Clubber route] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvY_r6pULO0 Dahvie and Jay making an ass of themselves with hardcore].

{{quote|Hes lost inside his mind (x2) / All into himself / Nothing deep inside / We tried to warn you (x2) / HE LIES (x2)|Garrett telling teenage girls [[Pedophile|the harsh truth]]}}

As of the release of their "first" album, '''Epic''', the music that's been released so far has been an endless bitch-fest of Emo-laced, poorly-written trite about how depressing life must be. At least, how depressing it must be to be Dahvie Vanity, which would make sense if he wasn't [[asking for it|a rapist that brings it all on himself in the first place]]. It's clear that Dahvie has done his research on [[Lady GaGa|the kind of music that sells]], making "softcore" tracks and claiming that [[Haters Make Me Famous|all the haters will make him bigger]] if they call him out for it. Oh, and of course calling out a kid, but more on that later.

=== Thievery ===

If you're wondering why most of that god-awful racket above sounded familiar, it's probably because someone ''else'' did it. Along with [[Autotune|Autotuning]] their vocals, if you can call them such, their music has been similar to or outright ripped from another song's structure, chorus, or even whole songs. Some identified examples so far include:

*[[Deadmau5]] song, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KTxNTxTtm0 Faxing Berlin], which pieces of it can be heard in part-sequence in the song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPu3DGy3LL4 Siq With A Q]
*[[Crunkcore|Breathe Carolina]] tracks like "Diamonds" have been [[some argue|largely contested]] as the basis for most of the recent BOTDF album, Epic; you can definitely hear the same chords and synth arp-ing. In non-music geek, that's stating [[Theft|srs borrowing]] on the part of this band.
*[[Chiptune]] artists would/should pitch a bitch about songs like Sexting and Bitches Get Stitches.
*"Respect for the dead? What's that?" Their [[Shit|Tribute]] to [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] song "Beat it" can be heard here; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShgaoaCU3dI]. They managed to make the song sound more about [[shota]]-loving than MJ can ever dream of. [[Bisexual|Maybe Dahvie is trying]] [[pedo|to tell his audience something?]]
*[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdMs-z71x70 They've done it before], this time they ripped off [[NIN]] song "Closer". Most NIN fans, who have heard the song, are praying for Dahvie to become [[an hero]].

==Rape Allegations==

{{quote|<@WhiteMystery>	everybody's raped a teenage girl once or twice, whatever|Speaking to [[WhiteMystery]] about his future [[trap|wife]]}}
<br />

The original band's line-up broke up after [http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1335411 Dahvie decided to rape more than the ears of a loli]. There is no question that it's rape, because no one in their right mind would sleep with such a [[ugly|fugly]] mutant. This all happened during the '''"OMFG Tour"''' during the late Summer/Fall of [[2009]]. Coincidentally, this tour came through [[User:ShardDax|the creator of this article's town]], and he got to meet this and other bands on the tour mere days before the rape. To quote:

{{quote|[[Irony|You would not believe how many teenagers I've been fucking since this tour started.]]|Dahvie to [[User:ShardDax|Dax]] and others in-between sets}}

{{quote|[[Pedobear|Awee Dahverz Ur Not A PedoBear Chur Muh PedoBear!.]]|] Jessi Slaughter to Dahvie about there oh so special retationship on myspace }}

Immediately following such [[Lulz|confessions of guilt]], Garrett's life would make a turn for the [[Gay|strange]], and Dahvie's for the [[Pedo|tragic]]. In the Fall of [[2009]], Dahvie [[fact|"allegedly"]] slept with a 16-year-old girl and she reported him at the [[RAEG|behest]] of her pissed-off parents (possibly after getting her morning-after pills).

Lyrics from "Scream For My Ice Cream"}}

[[Image:Dahvie_and_Jeffree_Star.JPG|220px|thumb|left|Dahvie serenades Trannies during their mating ritual]]

Garrett already had problems dealing with the midget's faggotry, then to have to deal with THIS [[drama]] finally pushed him over the edge, and he "quit" the band mid-tour, refusing to ever work with Dahvie again. However, the other faggot bands he was touring with preferred the company of people ''without'' [[Mexican|criminal records and pending trials]] for [[rape]]. Instead they sided with [[white|whitey]], told the Mexican [[pedobear|kid-fucker]] to GTFO, and let Garrett hang around, despite his [[Epic Fail|choices in friends]], for the rest of the tour. Dahvie, in an fit of [[BAW]] and [[DGT|revenge]], began to blame Garrett for all of his problems, and even at times tried to pen his own rape allegations on ''him''.

After the drama blew over in early [[2010]], Dahvie continued raping the land with [[Jeffree Star]] and some other [[transgender|trannies]]. Not even a year later, he [http://www.stickydrama.com/2010/06/dahvie-vanity-does-it-again/ worked on another potential rape victim] at the fine age of [[Jailbait|16]].

[[Last Thursday]] he was linked to an [[Jessi Slaughter|11-year-old loli]], and accused of having sex with her. Now he has [http://gawker.com/5589721/the-art-of-trolling-inside-a-4chan-smear-campaign some smear problems of his own]. If he and his [[Haters Gonna Hate|haters]] keeps this up, he may catch up to the records of [[Gary Glitter]] and [[Jerry from Doomsday Refreshment Committee|Jerry]], and at the very least, [[asking for it|warrant this article on his faggotry]] right here on [[ED]].

==The BOTDF Cult==
Also known as the '''[[Cutting|Slash Gash]] [[AIDS|Terror]] [[Cock|Crew]]''' (or [[SNCA|SGTC]]), Dahvie has a [[cult]]-like fan following of [[12 year old girls|10-15 year old girls]] who think he is [[Jesus]] and agree with everything he says. Just like every other false messiah, he [[rape|molests]] the kids in his flock.

[[Image:Hitler_makes_you_famous.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Hitler]] was also made famous due to [[Haters Make Me Famous|haters]]]]

Most [[Crunkcore]] bands [[troll|troll themselves]], by being as hideous to the opposite sex as possible, and making horrible [[shit|music]] that they'll never be able to live down. Of course, very few truly have earned the right to a [[victim complex]] as much as Dahvie, mostly by his own retarded, glitter-nailed hand.

After all of recent drama, he came about once again to start mouthing off at his [[h8|haters]]. Then he spoofed the video of [[Jessi Slaughter]], his [[loli|11 year old fan]] who he was accused of raping, to once more make it look like it was [[asking for it|all the girl's fault]]. In fairness, in most rape cases, [[Fact|it usually is]].
Here is the link to one young lady who claims he tried to "get with her" [http://www.myspace.com/9938595] Gentle cajoling may yield a statement.

<center>'''Dahvie once more tries to [[Jessi Slaughter|play off his guilt with moar faggotry]]'''</center>
<br />
Since this incident went public, [[troll|rational people]] have begun "Operation: The Consequences" to help raise the [[RAEG|ire]] of the cult members on Twitter and Facebook, by using the following:

'''RT #theyhatemebecause I tell them the truth #DahvieVanityisaRapist #DahvieVanityisaPedophile #DahvieVanityMolestsChildren'''

The hashtag topic Jessi started on her Twitter page, '''#DahvieVanityMolestedMe''', is the pre-cursor to the creation of the above quote used on most Twitter and Facebook pages. Of course, it's pretty easy to mark the other variations when you can see who's still posting them to this day.

''Operation: The Consequences'' imparted the term "[[Moralfag|Moral]][[troll]]" when it stated boldly that it's intentions were to catch a pedo and put him behind bars, possibly out of [[Troll's Remorse]] from the past. They stirred the toilets of the internet until shit started to rise, and when it rose it sincerely fouled the panache of scenekid chatrooms everywhere. The links on the bottom of this article can assist any haters that would like to make him famous. Other ideas are floating around, so by all means, [[Google|find them]]. To avoid [[Jessi Slaughter|potential back-tracing]], we are refraining from listing them at this time. In general, the best approach to putting this fag pedophile behind bars would be [[SFB|to use tact]]. This may take a while. Thus is the bane of the Moraltroll.

After Jessi Slaughter linked a parody video of Dahvie-cum-pedo on her Twitter page, and began speaking in earnest about her real opinions of Dahvie, BOTDF were [[Forced Meme|forced to retort]].

In a fit of passive-aggressive pussy-footing, Dahvie and Jay made a "soft" track to troll the ever-loving hell out of [[Jessi Slaughter]] and some of the other trolls who've recently become a part of his [[Lynch Mob|"fan-base"]]. It's unsure if this was supposed to scare most sane people off, or was even supposed to be considered a "master troll" on the part of these two blatant homosexuals, but the fact it was made is a sign that [[U MAD|there was an effect on their status]]. Now remember, this is a song about an 11-year-old girl ruining their lives, and these are guys in their mid-20s. [[Pussy Troll|What could be the problem here, eh?]] A potential sign of their ever-increasing [[Shame|fame]], this video marks the effect of haters who dared speak their mind.

<br />
Some would note the extreme lacking of [[Jessi Slaughter|name-drop]] besides [[You Dun Goofed|the obvious name of the song]]. It's awfully funny that his chosen target is a girl who claims she was [[Rape|raped]] by Dahvie Vanity, and the remainder of the song is also about [[Music Portal|nameless "haters"]] and [[Twitter|people calling them Nazis, pedophiles, and faggots]]. The lyrics are god-awful and juvenile, like something [[Chris-Chan]] would write in one of his comics with just slightly better spelling. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULceVFn_yxc See for yourself] though it's suggested you mute your speakers to not actually hear this musical equivalent to AIDS. The whole way the song/troll is composed is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE4zF36dPxE also very familiar...]

Judging by the personal nature of this attack, and considering the mental fragility of a now 12 year old girl from the South who just got raided hardcore, fans and haterz alike can safely expect myriad youtube reactions in the near future, in addition to possible preteen suicide.

Jessi starts 7th grade in two weeks. Ask this [http://twitter.com/LittleMonsta561 this guy], Matty, what he thinks of Dahvie if you want [[Lulz|justice]] and can be intelligent about the pursuit of it.  He claims on Twitter that part of this new BOTDF song is about him (him and pretty much anyone that EDited this page, page, moar like), and has been none-to-shy about "making Dahvie famous". He is staunchly [[H8|Anti-BOTDF]], may help acquiesce truth, and possibly lulz.

Apparently, Jeffree Star was going to be leaving the tour for a few months due to [[Dead Friend|someone he knew dying]], so he just didn't give a fuck what he said (though we all know by now it's the [[truth]]). In the same 24-hour period, Pedo Dahvie quickly went into [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|Damage Control Mode]] and started assembling his SGTC-fantards and [[lies|thanking them for supporting him]] and his lust for [[loli]] [[rape]]. He even went so far as to have a meeting on [[Stickam]] (audio of interviews [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHsTXODYBdM here] and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wY7VEhCFo here]) to explain the situation to his suddenly-smaller group of scenesters. He made claims about loving his fans (see [[Jessi Slaughter]] and above song for [[irony|how much he loves his fans]]), calling Jeffree a drug addict liar (which he is, but that's a moot point here), and even bringing in other tour-mates to tell people [[Michael Jackson|it's all lies and people are being ignorant]]. By now, many of his former fans online were highly skeptical, and told him to [[GTFO|fuck right off]], but a few of the sheep were re-re-re...[[Retard|re-re-re]]-convinced that their messiah was '''A-OK'''!

Like all man-children in denial of their history of [[faggotry]], Dahvie has expressed his dislike for Jeffree in the most immature ways possible [[2008|in the past]], and [http://www.examiner.com/crime-in-newark/of-course-eminem-was-on-bruno-s-mtv-stunt ripping off Eminem in the process] - he made a [[irony|fucking]] [[Mexican|piñata]] of the tranny that ''made'' the tour he's currently lucky to still even be on. [[Some argue|Some argue]] this goes beyond the realm of everything he has done to Jessi Slaughter. The comments of the video from the scenefag community quickly reveal the backfire of Dahvie's intentions, fully exposing him, even to his blind fans. [[You|You]] can help by further provoking Jeffree into leaking [[moar|moar]] ragetruth about the fat beaner.
