'''The Great Habbo Raid''' of July 12 (Fuck you, [[Europe]]), 2006 was an online version of The Million Man March to protest the racism of the [[Habbo]] mods.  It was the first of a series of raids to end all raids. This raid was run by Mikeyk? who later was hacked and IP banned shortly after. At the time of the ban Mikeyk? was spotted as a "white man". [[Some argue|Some say]] he was the most powerful man in Habbo...

==The First Raid==

The raid was plotted out [[in the ass]]hole of the internet, that is to say, [[B|/b/]], as a massive protest concerning the recent outbreak of [[AIDS]] in the pool. The date of July 12th was chosen for the raid; of note, this is the official birthday of the [[Bill Cosby|jello nigra himself]]. [[Over_9000|Over 9,000]] [[Internet]] warriors of [[B|/b/]], [[YTMND]], [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[myg0t]], [[Bantown]], and possibly [[Purelily]] got in the traditional clothing: black man with afro, suit, matching creased pants, and black loafers. Starting at around 2pm PST (though scheduled for 7pm PST), they started hitting the pools. Then they hit the library. A select few even went after private rooms, where they were nearly invincible from banning. The plan was to distract all mods using the pool floors while other nigras would fuck around on the rest of the hotel. At about 8:30 PST, a lot of people got bored of it and went on to international hotels. Specifically to call everyone in the Japanese hotel a chink and to make swastikas (Âçê) in habbohotel.de. Flooding techniques included the eponymous [[Desu]], Developers Developers Developers Developers, racist jokes, [[furry]] [[yiff|shit]], [[Cracky-chan]], [[Longcat]], [[loldongs]], other [[meme]]s from the five powers, and an odd scene of African-Americans grouping together in the form of a [[nazifur|swastika]].

==Organized Ruin==

[[Image:Supernigra.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tookie Williams|Stanley "Tookie" Williams]] was the original hardcore [[nigra|nigra]], racking up 78 successful [[aids|pool closings]] before his execution for killing a grip of [[china|chinks]]. Nevar Forget!]]

The [[IRC]] chat #Poolsclosed on [[gay|Rizon]] jumped from 10 people to nearly 200 as the forces built against Habbo Hotel, and it was eventually (and finally) reset, which resulted in a win. [[Bantown]] also ran a Habbo channel where much of the raid was planned out and squadrons of soldiers were made up to attack private rooms as well as public. Every nigra was used wisely, and when every public room was blocked, they moved on to non-[[English]] speaking hotels. Also, notable victories over Habbo include the fact that habbodiscussion.com, the official Habbo Hotel forum, was inadvertently DDOS'ed for hours on end and consequentially because of the massive raids, closed to new members.  It is worth noting that it only took 396 simultaneous users to bring habbodiscussion crashing to its knees, during what was intended to be a forum raid and not a DDOS.  The results were quite impressive.

As of 2:30AM EST, there were still small groups of forces from 4Chan still patrolling the hotel, blocking nearly unobstructed because most of the moderators decided to get some sleep. To supplement the ruining, a [[phishing]] site was created [http://bantown.org here].

==TOW revisionism==

Despite all the evidence indicating otherwise, in a situation reminiscent of [[Holocaust denial]], [[TOW]] refuses to believe that the Great Habbo Raid of July 2006 actually happened. This further highlights the ineptitude of the [[bureaucratic fuck]]s in charge.

==How to summon ruination==

[[Image:Poolsclosed.jpg|thumb|Logo used after the raid]]

[[Image:Schoolsclosed.jpg|thumb|[[Harry Potter|J/K Rofling gets in on teh lulz]].]]

*[[B|/b/]]! 
*[[YTMND]]! 
*[[Encyclopediadramatica|ED]]! 
*[[myg0t]]! 
*[[Bantown|BT]]!

By your powers combined, I am the [[ruination]] of [[Habbo Hotel]].

==The Aftermath==

[[Image:Raid-FIK-01.jpg|thumb|right|Keep it with you, you never know when it'll come in handy.]]

*<s>AIDS, nigra (including and variation of the word such as n.i.g.r.a., etc), and harbl are now blocked words in Habbo.</s> AIDS, harbl and n!gra/n!gger are not blocked.
*Caturday, business, loli, nigra, the phrase "black power" (and any [[leet|leetspeak]] variation thereof), and the phrase "bowl of copypasta" are now unacceptable in usernames in the US.
*The phrase "dancing anime" is unacceptable in usernames in Australia and Canada.
*The U.S. Hotel shut down temporarily.
*Habbodiscussion, the official forum, crashed and closed registration to new users. Also, Drama and lulz occurred.
*Many noble [[B|/b/]]tards were lost. NEVAR FORGET THEM. 
*[[TOW]] protected the entry for Habbo. 
*Other Sulake sites such as [[Cokemusic]] have also seen small nigra infestations.
*The beverage vendor at the pool now spouts anti-[[B|/b/]] phrases such as "The Habbo pool is the cleanest pool you could swim in!" and "The Pool Deck is the best moderated room in all of Habbo!"
*The entire [[nigra|nigra]] population has been galvanized like never before against all forms of [[AIDS|AIDS]] in pool and anti-[[nigra|nigra]] bigotry by [[white|the white man]].
*[[nigra|Any well dressed black man]] is now getting [[banned]] by TEH MODS.  It appears that this will continue until the mods grow up or /b/ raids the shit out of Habbo such that the mods surrender. Unfortunately, neither has a lead. Disguises to avoid a ban include lolicons, furries (lol), Epic Fail Guys, and white wimminz. Stay tuned for more details.

==The Second Raid==

[[Image:SCREEN9.JPG|thumb|Some celebrities even showed up to support the cause.]]

On [[9/11]]/2006, the nigras did it again.  Filling up the pool and many other rooms, the Habbo mods completely failed.  Lines of proud, black nigras filled the pool area, creating mass havoc for all of the faggot 10 year olds playing the game.  The win is attributed to [[Afroduck|AFRODUCK]], the leader of all nigras, who watches over the pool at all times.

===The Aftermath===
Even days after the full raid, noble nigras still flooded the hotel, creating another notable and unplanned block on the 14th.  Apparently, some new faggot mod tried to stop them, only to be showered in DESUs and YOU FAILs.

==Third Raid==
[[Habbo Revisited]] 2 began at Midnight on October 30, 2006. When it started, [[at least 100]] Nigras participated in the raid and stayed at the pool area. In it they met many gangs, pwnt many [[white]] [[women|wimminz]], and other fools who thought they had the authoritah to stand up to them. Those stander-uppers were crapped on. And they also [[lie|pwned the crap out of the hotel]]. In conclusion, [[fail|EPIC FAIL]].

This was, until June 2009, [[Fact|known to be]] the worst raid EVAR.

Some recent research conducted using advanced techniques in [[common sense]] concluded that most people chose not to be home on Halloween.

== The Great Reunion ==

On [[The_Great_Habbo_Raid_of_July_2007|7/12/07]] many proud nigras returned to Habbo for another victory against the ridiculously racist habbo mods.  Several mini raids took place beforehand, causing mods and [[13 year old boy]]s to shit themselves in terror. The HIVengance was at hand.

This time, the mods decided to announce the day as "International Afro/Suit Day" in an attempt to quell the rising tide of nigras. It was to become known as [http://www.habbo.com/news/rocket_goodbye_comp.html Habbocalypse Now].

[[Image:mod message.jpg|center]]

<s>An IRC channel was also created to discuss the reunion. [irc://irc.rizon.net/habboreunion #habboreunion@irc.rizon.net]</s> This room is more dead then your mom's feelings for [[You|you]]

==Two Years Later==

Yet again, Habbo Hotel was raided by the nigras. As predicted another Internet victory was had, as Habbo Canada's modfaggotry was no match for the /b/lockaders.

==Newfag Doing It Wrong==

<s>Nigraz made their comeback in early 2009 with the outsmarting of the new "Answer to /b/lockades".the hero noticed they can get in the pool, but by standing in the place used usually for Blocking them from getting in, you can block them from getting out.all this was created by one habbo, with the chant "You cant get out but you cant get in, therefore i, epic win!"</s> [[DISREGARD THAT, I SUCK COCKS]].

the habbo's name was:

<s>'''ThisIs4chan'''</s> '''AFuckingNewfag'''

==You're Doing It Wrong==

The memory of the great Habbo raids being defiled by [[newfag]]s -

[[Image:Raid09-croped.PNG|center]]

[[Rules 1 and 2]] were broken numerous times. A [[Swastika|swastiget]] attempt was later made, and much [[fail]] ensued.
