'''Ashley Hoilman''', aka. '''Ted-Drakness''', aka. a failed abortion on it's mother's behalf is a [[bipolar]] DevianTART with a [[fangirl|certain appreciation]] for [[Jhonen Vasquez|Johann Sebastian Vasquez]], and probably [[buttsecks|friends]] with [[Katy]]. It is renowned for being a retard of astronomical levels and hermaphrodite skank that changes love interests as much as one changes underwear, but it's highly doubted that she's even mentally capable of even such simple tasks. It's hobbies include being batshit insane, [[Transgender|pretending to be a dude]], [[Crybaby|whining incessantly]], faking it's own death, [http://sluggie.deviantart.com/ ban evasion], and [[pedophilia]].

It's gallery is almost entirely filled with [[rule 34|more than its share of traumatizing fanart]], save for a couple of admittedly [[Photoshop|impressive original paintings]] which soon followed suit after her recent [[delusional|love affair]] with an internet user [[shit nobody cares about|whose real identity still remains uncertain.]] Why yes, it did believe [[anonymous|a complete stranger on the internet]] when he randomly approached it and told it he was [[Jhonen Vasquez|Jonah Vasquiz]]. THEY HAD A VERY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP OKAY.

Their relationship abruptly ended when Ted-Drakness [[Fake internet deaths|committed e-suicide]] after learning the startling truth about it's true love [[Jhonen Vasquez|John Vespa]].

It's all for the best though - Ted-Drakness' <s>new-found</s> hobby for creating heartfelt journal entries about [[Unwarranted self-importance|horrible things that happen in her pathetic life]] of an epic length can't allow it the spare time to leave it's parents' [[basement]], let alone handle an e-[[boyfriend]].

Watch out for the [[lol|impending lawsuit]] from this: Ted-Drakness has written over 200 words about how it is going to sue ED. RUH-ROH.

Ted-Drakness was also a member of the "I Hate Encyclopedia Dramatica" club on [[DeviantART]], both before this article was written, and before [http://pillow-lover7.deviantart.com/ pillow-lover7] [[delete fucking everything|deleted fucking everything]].

==Emotional [[surprise sex|Raep]]==
In an extremely [[TL;DR]] but recent blog entry posted [[last Thursday]], Ted describes what has been [[fanfiction|going on]] between it and "[[lie|Mr. Vasquez]]" for [[at least 100 years]] now. She first began to suspect that her [[an hero|whole life has been a lie]] when it messaged him and he wasn't an [[asshole]]. When they [[cybersex|cybered]] as the lonely shepherd and a very naughty sheep, it still seemed somehow in the realm of plausibility, but it was when he expressed concern for fires going on in the same state as him, that things began to look shady. To it's [[wtf|dismay]], it turns out that [[ZOMG]]! "JCVasquezTHM on AOL is NOT JV!!"

[[Image:What has science done.jpg|thumb|I can't imagine how this could have started out bad...]]

{{squote|. . .today I found out something that has ripped my heart out and destroyed me completely. I began to get suspicious of this person when he told me he was evacuated due to the CA fires, but San Jose is no where near where they were. Today I e-mailed Dan from SlaveLabor and he contacted Jhonen and e-mailed me back saying that this person that I spent half a year in love with, half a year worrying about, getting to know, and over half a year devoted to...was not Jhonen.|Ted-Drakness|on common sense}}

{{squote|The real JV replied to me on MySpace and told me to stay away from anyone claiming to be someone famous, he was kind enough to answer me which made me feel a lot better. I'm trying to remind myself that the real JV did not do this to me so that it won't ruin my love for him and his fandom.|Ted-Drakness| on keeping priorities in order}}

{{quote|Hey. So like... Don't talk to people who claim to be famous on the internet, k?|Jhonen Vasquez|on sympathy}}

Ted then begins to explain to the internet that it feels "[[butthurt|emotionally raped]]" and will be needing to [[flounce|collect her toys and leave the sandbox]] for now.

Just think, all the time wasted on crafting this epic of a textwall could have been better spent acquainting her major arteries with a razor blade.

==Internet Lawsuit==
Ted goes on to say that it will be definitely be calling in the [[whambulance|party van]] for the emotional damage it has endured. Mr. Anon C. Vasquez, obviously having forgotten that [[serious business|the internet is serious business]], has [[lulz|unrightfully stolen]] the online identity of a [[douchebag|very important person]], and can be sure to see it in [[internet trial|internet court]] sometime in the [[caturday|next week]].

{{quote|I've cried until I can not cry anymore. . . and in the end, all he had to say was 'I'm sorry.' And then asked me not to press charges... You're damn straight [[I'M PRESSIN CHARGES]]. But no amount of charges will take back what they did to me.|Ted-Drakness|on healthy relationships with real people}}

[[your mom|Her mom]] assures us that Ted will be perfectly fine, saying that it had pretty much the same reaction when it found out that [[Santa]] wasn't real.

[[Image:Dead-santa.jpg|thumb|Santa, emotional rape... Same thing.]]

{{quote|Yeah, it will be fine. It had pretty much the same reaction whenever it found out that Santa isn't real. |Ted's mom|on totally seeing this coming}}

AnonV. can expect to face a long sentence in [[internet jail]], as [[E-lawyers]] are relentless and [[Honorary Ed Lolington]] don't mess around. [[city_glitter|'''CRIME DOES NOT PAY.''']]

==Recovery==
Despite the recent loss, Ted is doing all it can to BE STRONG and begin on it's way toward a [[an hero|full recovery]] from this [[serious business|grave]] online tragedy.

{{squote|I am going to be alright, know that. It may take me a long time before I'm myself again, and I will never get over this completely, I'll always be scarred from it. But I'll press on, it's one of the hardest things I've had to deal with, but I'll deal with it. I'm going through different stages of recovery and it may be a long time before I'm myself again, but I think I'll be fine..or as fine as someone in my position could be.|Ted-Drakness|on staying strong in the face of imaginary adversity}}

It has started by leaving [[DeviantArt]], quitting painting altogether, and setting up a new [http://www.myspace.com/jimmyzbiggestfan MySpace] <s>shrine</s> page. In closing, the thing reminds us all that [[Jhonen Vasquez|Jihadnenon]] does not like his name to be butchered. So please stop raeping the good name of Mr. Vasqueeze, plzthx.

{{quote|Jhonen: It's pronounced fhsfwhfjk, learn that.|Ted-Drakness|on not fucking it up. Jesus, you guys.}}

==A [[emo|Heartfelt]] Response==
[[Image:Dib naked by TedDrakness.jpg|thumb|[[shota|'''LIES, ALL OF IT''']] ]]
[[Image:SqueeStrapONTedDrakness.gif|thumb|[[CP|'''LIESSSSSSSSSS''']] ]]

Goodness gracious me! Apparently Ted-Drakness does not appreciate Encyclopedia Dramatica using this page to "<nowiki>[tell]</nowiki> '''lies''' on everyone they can think of for the ''lulz''" (moar liek for the attention amirite?). Of course by "everyone they can think of" it means it's self, because you know,it's not the first and only beast we "tell lies on" ('''LIES LIES LIES''' AND WE BACK NOTHING UP WITH EVIDENCE oh wait shit [[DISREGARD THAT|disregard that]]), yet only now is it speaking out against teh haet.

Speaking out, you say? Welp, we can [[George Zimmer|guarantee]] that this ain't lies. After finding out about this beautiful piece of prose you are reading, Ted-Drakness posted yet another rather tl;dr journal outlining '''THE LIES''' we are telling. The lengthy diatribe can be read in full [http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/f/f1/EDliessssss.PNG here,] but please allow us to quote from it for your amusement:

{{quote|I am [...] a pedophile|[http://ted-drakness.deviantart.com/journal/15370637/ Ted Drakness]}}

And that's '''no lie'''!

If you can honestly read all the way through that cluster fuck of words then more power to you. ''IT IS FOUR PAGES LONG''. It is more than five hundred words longer than the article that spawned it (and only after this nifty wall-o-text section was added)! Keep in mind most of this article is quotes from Ted-Drakness [[hir]]self.

Mmmyes, you certainly have no unhealthy obsessions, Ted-Drakness.

==The Vasquez Response==
Upon reading this article, [[Jhonen Vasquez|Hornen]] had the following to say amidst trying to choke down the urge of vomiting even briefly:
{{quote|[[Image:ExplodingHead.gif]]<br>...and don't forget to buy from Slave Labor.|[[Jhonen Vasquez]]| on ED}}

==Hot for Granny==
[[Image:Hotforgramma.jpg|thumb]]
[[Image:Tedjourndrama1.jpg|thumb]]
In more recent lulz, it has confessed to thinking Ms. Bitters is hot and probably faps to her wrinkly image in her spare time as well. Then again, who could expect less from DA's biggest bipolar lunatic considering what she already likes? Yep, you bet your fugly deranged ass we're posting it.

==Not even her parents like her==
As of late last year and part of early 2009, Ted had a falling out with it's parents which eventually led to them both moving out because thanks to an inside source. Neither of them could stand it's incessant bitching, bipolar mood swings and general retardedness. Certainly all of which combined must have reached levels previously thought unknown to man for even it's own parents to split if that says anything about her being able to be a part of society of EVER being able to have a half sane love interest at all. Which it really DOES.

Most baffling of all is it's relationship between it and it's father which it claims molested it as a kid, which it hates him for and has even claimed to have developed a fear of intimacy from.
Even so it has been known to fantasize on it's journal and has even drawn father/son incest as well as pedophilia. One might conclude it secretly gets jollies thinking about what Papa Hoilman did to it but only claims to be traumatized to get extra special asspats from those foolish enough not to see how depraved the she-beast really is.  

As for it's mother, she has ran off with a 50 something guy and contacts Ted from time to time if only to bitch it out or send it presents, which leads one to believe she does this either to toy with her retard daughter's emotions or she is just as fucking apeshit nuts as her daughter. If in fact she is toying with it, it seems to be working thus proving what a complete and astounding idiot Ted is considering that a more recent journal praised mama for remembering it's B-day.


From the looks of things, Mama Hoilman's new man was only telling the truth.
