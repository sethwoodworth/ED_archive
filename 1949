[[Image:FirstClass.jpg|thumb|right|First Class all the way for $Spyed and his Jew.]]

'''The devianTART World Tour 2009''' is a great big [[lulz]]y [[sarcasm|holiday adventure]] provided for two lucky [[admin]]z (one the Jew!!!1!1!111one!!11)! Of course Jew and [[feminazi|$Heidi]] totally deserve a little trip around the world for all the great and worthy effort they put into making people give them money - ''to improve the site for the public'' (and pay for 1<sup>st</sup> class tickets and several mansions in Hollywood)!

{{quote|WTF happened to Saturday?!?!|$Heidi|on her failed attempt to count days of the week.}}

The team has just departed from Los Angeles and are still suffering from having jet lag - oh, the sacrifices they make for their adoring [[deviantART|TARTlets]], makes you feel so grateful; [[Jesus|just like what Jesus did for us with the Romans and dying and all the other shit I learrnt but have now forgot!]] They've arrived now in sunset city Sydney, the uncapital of [[Austria]] where they'll meet the loving [[Josef Fritzl|Aussies]] for the first time! Bet they can't wait.

===Overall===

[[Image:Adminz.jpg|thumb|right|Yes, seriously, these ''are'' the people who run [[devianTART]]. (I hate the retards who always spazz out at the front of photos.)]]

The journey's path ''overall'' has been kept a mystery for a [[bullshit|reason we all know will prove useful to us in someway or another]] in the near future. What is known: 

*Forty Days long.
*<s>Cities most populated by [[deviantART|TARTlets]].</s> '''See Below.'''
*Burn Subscribers money with first class. 
*Meeting at art centers in each city (i.e Sydney Opera House).
*Both $Heidi and $Spyed will keep everyone updated through journals.

==Call for [[B&]] Ones== 
If you've experienced a [[fellatio|blow]] from the mighty [[banhammer]] on dA, then you may want to make a scene about it! It has been recommended by [[user:poliwhorelovesyah|Successful Troll]] (blatant self advertising) that you make sure to attend a deviantMEAT, and cause as much [[lulz|dArama]] as possible! There is a vast potential for epic lulz to be had - make sure you film it!!!11!11!1!eleven1

==Cities Visited so Far:==
*[[Hollywood|Los Angeles]]
*[[Austria|Sydney]]
*[[poverty|Singapore]]
*[[Poland|Warsaw]]
*[[Turkey|Constantinople]]
*[[Nazi|Berlin]]
*[[British|London]]

==Correlations in Cities Visited==
It has now become blatantly obvious that the cities being visited, are '''not''' being visited because they have a high number of [[deviantart|TARTlets]], nor because the TARTlets are dA fanatics. Instead, the cities chosen, are chosen simply because they are places $Heidi would like to visit. Or where $Spyed's bureaucrat admin <s>friends</s> ''acquaintances'' live.
