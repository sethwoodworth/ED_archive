'''The Boondocks''' was originally a comic series created by black person [[weeaboo|Aaron McGruder]], and evolved into a nigger show.  Surprisingly, this show doesn't suck, unlike the rest of [[Adult Swim]]. Which is why it takes until the season is over before it comes on with any type of regularity. It is a double combo of [[animu]] and [[niggers]] which should suck like [[your mom]] on a Friday night but, [[O rly|it doesn't]], most times anyway. 

Commonly trying to be socially conscientious with out being to preachy it basically becomes a set formula:

<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>'''it will start:'''</td>
<td>'''[[win|Climax]]:'''</td>
<td>'''then will end:'''</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'''If the episode is about Huey'''</td>
<td>Him being [[Moralfag|moralistic and preachy]]</td>
<td>[[Animu]]-style fighting</td>
<td>Him being [[Moralfag|moralistic and preachy]]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'''If the episode is about Riley'''</td>
<td>with him being a black person</td>
<td>with him being a black person</td>
<td>with him being a black person</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'''If the episode is about Grandad.'''</td>
<td>him whining about being old</td>
<td>gets a girl, [[DO NOT WANT|fucks her]]</td>
<td>Loses her, starts over</td>
</tr>
</table>

== Features ==

* [[Gangsta|Gangstas]] wannabes
* Movie References
* [[Wiggers]]
* Pop culture references
* [[Lemonparty|Senile men wincing and prancing around naked]]
* References to [[GNAA|gay rappers]]
* [[Your mom|Bitches]] and their pimp daddies
* Black celebrity reference/cameo/parody
* Facebook/Myspace
* [[Latarian Milton|IRL niggas]] doing their [[The Booty Warrior|lulzy shit]] in animated form

== Boondocks Drama==
As with all things [[cake|good]] there are numerous forces that try to change it into [[AIDS|something more wholesome and less derisive]]. Between [[BET]], [[Al Sharpton]], and [[Old media|the Washington Post]] all [[BAWW|complaining about the content of the show]] to the point that any lulz that came for the show should have been drained and replaced with anti-lulz, but the show managed to successfully troll IRL for 3 seasons. The crowning achievements being :
* Saying [[Black Jesus|Jesus was black]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] was the devil
* Calling New Orleans niggers lazy
* Have Martin Luther King say black person
* Hitting Rosa Parks with a piece of chicken
* A leftist program not having a [[circle jerk]] about [[Barack Obama|Obama]]
* Calling prominent black celebrities gay
* [[Truth|Calling BET, McDonalds, Nike, and many professional sports the root of all that's wrong with black people]]

Most people who haven't seen the show see it as:
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>'''care about Black people:'''</td>
<td>'''don't care about Black people:'''</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'''If White people...'''</td>
<td>they're stupid</td>
<td>they're racist
</tr>
<tr>
<td>'''If Black people...'''</td>
<td>they're going to die</td>
<td>they're Uncle Toms/Niggaz</td>
</tr>
</table>

And they are sort of right.

== Main Characters ==
[[File:Huey_freeman_packing.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Clearly this show is [[derp|progressive]], as the most militant darkie is packing heat]]
* '''[[Weeaboo|Huey Freeman]]''' The main character, a [[oxymoron|genius nigger]] [[Wapanese|who has talent with martial arts, samurai swords]] and unnatural penchant for [[Conspiracy Theory|conspiracy theories]], the latter of which has some influence over his wanting to ignite a [[Black Jesus|black, socialist revolution]]. He narrates most episodes and [[spoiler|gives away plot twists]]. Along with that, he is easily the most serious character in the show and rarely is directly responsible for any lulz, as he is often the [[lie|voice of reason]] and self-righteous. He is the [[Mod|authoritarian]] to his [[IRL Troll|younger brother]]. His afro is also always blown out.

:* ''Weapon:'' Anything [[weeaboo]]

:* ''Lulz Rating:'' 2/10, he makes a good joke here and there but he's a [[moralfag]] so it usually gets lost in his preaching.

:* ''Action Rating:'' 7/10, He fights when necessary but, [[DOING_IT_WRONG|a lot of times he just gets his ass whooped]], [[So cash|but looks cool doing it.]]

{{clear}}

[[File:Riley-Freeman2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|"black person [[you]] [[gay]]"]]
* '''[[Gangsta|Riley Freeman]]''' A typical black person who is fond of and tries to live by the [[So cash|gangsta lifestyle]]. Despite his age, he can inexplicably guide [[gangs]] of [[fucktard|thugs, wiggers, and thug wiggers]]. His usual followers are two recently returned [[Iraq|Iraq War veterans]] (voiced by [[Snakes on a Plane|Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[shit nobody cares about|Eddie Murphy's brother Charlie]], despite the characters being [[13 year old boys|20 something year old]] [[wiggers]]) or a trio of [[Rap|rappers]] called the [[GNAA|Lethal Interjection Crew]] or the kids of Woodcrest, through the suburban streets of [[Chicago|Woodcrest]]. He is an adept user of [[gun|firearms]] but, being a nigger this is not that surprising. Also surprising is the fact that he is one of the few [[Nigga Know Technology|niggers on the show shown to be able to use a computer.]]

:* ''Weapon:'' Fist and Guns

:* ''Lulz Rating:'' 10/10, 1st episode he shot someone through a window. 10 episodes later he tried to kidnap Oprah. 'nuff said, but [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-HhRH_gvPc if you need more proof...]

:* ''Action Rating:'' 5/10, While he is the [[/b/]] of the show that is double edged as he tends to stay out of most violent situations when it looks like he might get his ass whooped. He didn't win a fight until season 3. 

{{clear}}

[[File:Grand-dadFreemanMad.jpg|thumb|left|The old man from the "Friday" movies, in animu form]]
* '''[[Lemonparty|Robert "Bitches" Jebidiah Freeman]]''' is busy telling everyone how hard he had it, how much of a hero he was, and generally being an annoying old man. He has the task of raising the kids at the best of his capacity, which means that they are left for themselves except when he needs help on the computer. He enjoys [[DO NOT WANT|dancing around in his underwear]] and trolling [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]] for [[16 year old girl|young]] [[wimmins]] and then [[DO NOT WANT|telling people about his sexual exploits.]]

:* ''Weapon:'' Belt

:* ''Lulz Rating:'' 5/10 Most of his lulz come from him beating Riley or arguing with Ruckus or any one else ,but before long it just become boring.

:* ''Action Rating:'' 9/10 He's the [[admin]] of the show. Hell, in the Nigga Moment episodes he killed a black person, sent him back to hell, and then sent his friends to jail. 

{{clear}}

* '''[[Racism|Uncle Ruckus]]''' [[God|A HUGE FAT BALD NIGGER]]. Basically, he's a black white-supremacist. He [[what|hates black people when he is clearly the darkest character in the show]]. Has a penchant for attempting to [[Buttsecks|appease]] [[The Man|the white man]] and [[Nice try|claims]] to be of [[Ireland|Irish]], [[France|French]] and [[Native Americans|Cherokee]] descent. It is seen that his mother raised him to believe he was white and she herself was a uncle tom(auntie tom?)

:* ''Weapon:'' Racist Trolling

:* ''Lulz Rating:'' 10/10 The most hated character on the show and IRL. [[Epic Win|Good Job]]

:* ''Action Rating:'' 1/10 had 1 episode where he fought Huey and that ended in a draw. The next time he was brought up in a fight he was jumped by 3 old niggas.

* '''[[Black Jesus|Tom Dubois]]''' The nigga named Tom, with a white wife and his mixed daughter named [[Loli|Jasmine]] and relatively normal except for his fear of [[Bubba|prison]]. The most boring character in the show. His daughter is constantly shipped with the Freeman boys and his wife... well just assume the worst. In the Season three opener Tom was dubbed a lamer version of [[Barack Obama]]

:* ''Weapon:'' [[Manly Tears]]

:* ''Lulz Rating:'' When he was possessed by [[4chan|Colonel H. Stinkmeaner]] 10/10 any other time he is [[EFG]]

:* ''Action Rating:'' See previous rating.

* '''[[Awesome|Colonel H. Stinkmeaner]]''' a.k.a the most lulzy thing about the series. Riley mixed with Uncle Ruckus is not as lulzy as this one character. He was the only character to take on the entire Freeman family and almost win. Yes, that's right Huey, Riley, and Grandad combined couldn't beat him until Riley smashed him in the head 3 times with lamps. 

:* ''Weapons:'' Whatever he wants Bitch NIGCKAH

:* ''Lulz Rating: 10/10'' 

:* ''Action Rating: 10/10''

==The Boondocks and The White Man==
[[Image:George cloney cartoon.gif|thumb|What The Boondocks thinks of the white man.]]
While the show started off as a preachy nigger loving [[circle jerk]] it quickly became an effective trolling effort against just about everyone , but especially blacks. The show while painting whites with a broad brush, shows nigger as overly indulgent, idiotic, false intellectuals, booty chasing, [[homophobic]], [[Not gay|closet-faggots]] who honestly shouldn't be able to function in daily life.White people have become the surrogate for black people as they are seen as relatively ignorant to the world around them and just wanting whats best for them. In fact the show rarely has a white antagonist and even then, they act like black persons.
