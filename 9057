[[IRL|In reality]] it can be difficult to find a book which describes the right technique on how to punch your partner in the back of the head during [[buttsecks]] without breaking their necks. Thanks to [[Wikipedia]] you can not only find out that your strange [[BDSM]] fetish is known as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_punch 'Donkey Punch'], but also which porn actress hated it the most.

However even by internet standards [[Wikipedia]] occasionally notices there are some edits and articles that little bit too retarded to be real.


==Hoax Articles==

Creating hoax articles is amazingly easy - all that is required to prevent them from calling "Bullshit!" is external sources. Want to show that the white man is the superior race? Link to [[Metapedia]]. Want to show the world is ruled by aliens reptiles? [[David Icke]] approves. An inner earth? Link to the only site which tells [[Truthism.com|the truth]] - proving that if you say something often enough it magically becomes true.

Most hoax articles As seen above the longest-lasting hoax was research on the clitoris, presumably created to show that wikipedos can be both intellectual ''and'' sexy. Amazingly they failed to notice the obvious fact that the clitoris doesn't exist, making the article itself a complete fake.
