== New Server ==
We have moved to a new sever. The down time over the past few days resulted in changing data centers and getting a new machine for better serving the lulz. If all goes according to plan we will no longer have to deal with site outages of any kind. [[crayolacrime]] and [[ghettofinger]] are helping with the move and it seems to have worked well. If you notice issues with the site, please contact a sysop for help. I'm really excited about things running smoothly and serving the lulz at a faster pace. ROCK! --[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 15:22, 14 July 2006 (UTC)


== TJC and IRC ==
To contact ED, you can now use [[TJC|The Thizzlehat Junction Center]]. For our IRC channel, use [irc://irc.bantown.com/ed]. --[[User:Sheneequa|Sheneequa]] 21:04, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== 3000 articles ==
Assmustard decided to make it anti-climatic though and make [[3000th article]]. --[[User:Sheneequa|Sheneequa]] 19:19, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

== Image uploads have been fixed ==
Just fyi, [[Special:Upload|Upload file]] has been fixed and it's working again. ~ [[User:Krade|Krade]] <sup>[[User_talk:Krade|hi yo~</sup>]] 03:20, 27 Feb 2006 (UTC)

== .wmv and .avi uploads! ==
I've added two new file formats and increased the max file size for increased [[lulz]]! Users can now upload files ending in .wmv and .avi. and those files can be up to 8M in size. What fun! The first usage of the new feature is to upload the "Go fuck yourself [[Dick Cheney|Mr. Cheney video]]" Check it out! When using the new feature, don't forget to use the <nowiki>[[Media:funny_movie.wmv]]</nowiki> markup style.

We're also soon going to have a mailing list for daily [[lulz]] delivered straight to your [[inbox]] as well as a discussion list. I'm also considering putting up a jabber server. Lots of cool new things are coming up so don't forget to obsessively hit refresh [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent Changes]].

Lastly, I'd like to welcome the insane influx of [[Something Awful]] and [[Gorillamask.net]] users who have flooded the site with either awesome articles or plain idiocy. We love you!

== Love ==
Just a personal note from me, the head [[dramatician|drama doctor]], 

I wanted to thank everyone for the hard work they are putting into [[ED]]. I genuinely believe it's the funniest site on the [[internet]]. Thank you for all of your help. I'd especially like to thank the dedicated [[Special:Listadmins|ED Sysops]] who help promote like crazy, ban people with impunity and fight the great [[drama]] battles of the internet, not only here - but also abroad. Additonally, I would like to thank the awesome super editors who spend all day at work wasting time writing hilarious articles and keeping true to the [[lulz]]. We have some great new things in the works and I hope you will all be a part of the new endeavors.

With love and lulz,

== ED Triumphs ==
We are too busy here at ED to do anything other than create awesome articles for your personal enjoyment. Sorry. However, I heard there are some awesome new features coming soon! 

== Categories ==
The merger of the following categories is being considered:
# Furry Shit

== Important Message from the maintainers== 
You are all fucking awesome. --[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 22:59, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Featured Users Info ==
How does one get on the featured users area on the front page and how will this affect my [[street cred]]? --[[User:Imaybeparanoid|Imaybeparanoid]] 09:19, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Disclaimer update ==
The [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:General disclaimer|General disclaimer]] has been updated. Please review it and make sure that you are aware of its constraints. If you have a user account, you are subject to the disclaimer and its terms. I urge you to become famaliar with it. Also, the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:General disclaimer|Disclaimer]] clarifies the rules for participating in the site and also states that any user can be banned or blocked at any time for any reason by any of the users with SysOp access. --[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 00:31, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Banner contest winner, Meta request, Clarification of terms ==
Hallo. How's it going? Not much, you?

[[hardvice]] is the winner of the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Banner Contest]]! I already have his address, so his prizes will be on their way shortly. Also 2 months of paid LiveJournal time, which is a sucky but instant prize was an additional perk. However, LJ is not allowing payments at this time, most likely because [[Six Apart]] will soon be bought by [[Yahoo]]. Oh Joy. 

We are in desperate need of articles for meta stuff like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Help]] pages and especially the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:FAQ|ED FAQ]]. The better our [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:FAQ|FAQ]], the easier it will be to deal with newbies who have questions about how the site works and more quickly getting them assimilated and comfortable making edits. These articles should be edited by seasoned ED'ers or Wiki-nerds. You know who you are.

In closing, as always, I'd like to thank everyone who has been so helpful with all of the edits and working on the site. I genuinely am grateful for all your hard work. Actually, no one ever thinks it's work, they just think it's fun - so that's even better. Everyone appreciates it and I think it's shaping up to be a really funny and entertaining site. Oh, just one small point about &quot;funny and entertaining&quot;, this site is meant as a parody and satire site about [[the internets]]. We are here to poke fun at things and show them in an absurdist or humorous light. We're a political cartoon for the internet. 

If you are not comfortable with this as a satire and parody site, please do not visit the site and certainly do not make edits on it. Editing the site and using it to communicate illustrates your understanding of our [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:General disclaimer|disclaimer]] and your acceptance that the content of the site is for parody, not for serious. Got it? Ok. --[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 18:42, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== New year, new edits!  ==
Well, the holidays are over and it's the first full week of the new year. I expect incredible and lenghty edits from you all. PLEASE DO SOME. Also, the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Banner Contest]] only has 5 more days to go, so if you don't get your entry in, then you suck. Check the usual places for new edits that you can do, or start your own. Yea! Also, we're in need of some good, interesting and complete articles to use for the front page for &quot;Article of the Week&quot;. Recommend those on the [[ Talk:Main Page]]
--[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 17:25, 10 Jan 2005 (GMT)

== Front page funtime ==
I love front paging lj communities. I really want to use [[teenmommies]] for next week. Please add content and pics as you see fit. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;

== OMG!222 Breaking News ==
[[Image:Pwned.gif|thumb|pwned screenshot cause everyone missed it.]]
Due to our incredibly quick and efficient abilities to take the site down and put it back up again, our little fake defacing didn't work very well because no one saw it.  The good news is, we've moved off of the linode and onto our own super hardcore omg leet dedicated server. We are officially out of &quot;ED: The beta era&quot; and in &quot;ED v1.0&quot;

'''PLUR'''

Who wants a hug?

--[[hamtaro]]

Yes, we are aware of the ridiculous timeouts and downtime issues. We are addressing these as quickly as possible and fixing what we can. Sending aim messages to sn '''girlvinyl''' or '''modrama dot com''' with problems is appreciated. The server will be moved soon and all well be just fine. No one will notice the move. It's all good. Now let's hug.

Details for the nerdies: We are hosted with linode. Last night the amount of traffic we were generating caused extreme swap thrashing followed by a kernel panic. We downed the server for everyone on our lindoe and caused them considerable downtime. [[encyclopediadramatica|ED]] has been all but kicked off of their services. We are planning to move the site to a dedicated host within the next few days. Very little down time is anticipated, but the site may be slow. 
--[[User:Girlvinyl|girlvinyl]] 15:50, 13 Dec 2004 (PST)

'''GROWING POPULARITY MEANS DEDICATION'''

As stated below, [[Encyclopediadramatica|ED]] is looking to move to a dedicated server soon.
After a discussion last night with [[girlvinyl]] about that, and how popular the site has become 
in such a short time, I brought up the the idea of posting a paypal button so users could donate funds for the site if they happen to be in a generous mood.
I know that I, for one, would be willing to contribute, as would others.
Let's keep the site up and running at reasonable speeds.
Give up a few bucks in contribution!

--[[User:Scarlet|Scarlet]] 11:53, 13 Dec 2004 (PST)



'''WHY USER MODE LINUX SUCKS'''

I would like to apologize for the downtime that we experienced this evening. The main server that we are hosted on had a kernel panic and that did us in. We are looking to move to a dedicated server by the end of the month so if anyone knows of any good deals please send them my way. Also, please do not hesitate to aim me at 'modrama dot com' if you notice web problems or just want to chat. &lt;b&gt;I could use the E-PALS!12&lt;/b&gt;
