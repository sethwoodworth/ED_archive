ScriptLance
{{needsmoar|[[lulz]]}}

'''ScriptLance''' is a website devoted to "[[theft|Connecting]] [[business|Businesses]] with [[Script kiddie|Programmers]]." It is infested with [[Indian]]s and [[Korean]]s, most of whom want to commission or create the next [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]], or [[Google]], despite the fact that all such projects are doomed to [[fail]]. Also rampant is [[copyright infringement]], with many "programmers" using stolen versions of for-pay scripts or the same custom scripts promised to be unique to various clients.

==Ripping People Off==
Payment for services rendered is channelled through ScriptLance's own [[bullshit|Escrow]] service, where they hold funds hostage, much like [[PayPal]]. Whenever there is a complaint regarding the quality of service, payment issues, the phase of the moon, or other various perceived wrongs, they will lock up your money indefinitely, pocketing it themselves and [[banhammer|banning]] you from the site. Once you're out of the way, the filthy admins roll around in their ill-gotten gains while laughing at [[you]].

==R3N3==
ScriptLance is owned by a company that refers to itself as [[1337|R3NE International Inc.]][http://www.r3n3.com], which is run by a dirty [[Canadian]] who would like to hide from [[Internets]] scrutiny. Fortunately, [[Internet detective]]s have been able to locate their contact information:
