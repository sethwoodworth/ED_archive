Before [[Eric Bauman]] was stealing shit from [[Something Awful]], before [[emo]] [[camwhores]] were dumping their saggy tits all over [[Suicide Girls]], before [[4chan]] and [[9/11]], in a simpler time when [[goatse]] and [[tubgirl]] were still relevant, one man was there to deliver [[lulz]] and [[porn]] to you, the [[basement dwellers|internet surfers]], in a way that no one else could or would from then until present day.

The [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[History|Historical Society]] fondly looks back to bring you this account naming one of the only sites worth visiting before the turn of the century and the [[man]] in charge of it all. This article is about '''Amp''' of <strike>[http://amplovesyou.net Amp Loves You dot net]</strike>.

== Amp Loves You ==
Amp was the original distributor of the [[funnelgirl]] video. [[Some Argue]] the site was the number one source of [[shock]] images and video on the [[internet]], which to this day echo throughout [[forums]] and [[chans]], like a [[anime|ghost in the machine]] with [[dicks]] for eyes, vomiting [[shit]] onto a [[cake]]. Amp had taste.

== Blogs ==
Before [[LiveJournal]] caught ablaze with emo [[aspies]] this man was the single voice of [[RAGE|reason]] regarding all aspects of the human condition, not excluding the internet itself. Amp was truly a one-man Encyclopedia Dramatica.

{{quote|073005. full of shit.

nah, for real...t's 8 in the morning, on the 31st. I'm full of shit.

luckily for me, so is the entire rest of the world. Does god tell our good buddy George to light countries up like firecrackers? Fucking doubtful. Is Michael Jackson innocent, white, or heterosexual? I think not. Did I really get a check in the mail today for a million dollars, along with a magic coupon for 12 free CDs and about 80 different credit cards all somehow able to make my life simpler despite the fact that I owe about six THOUSAND dollars? Fuck.

but shit like that doesn't really bother me, see, and there's a reason. I'm too goddamn sleep-deprived to even ponder anything more complex than my own hand for longer than five seconds at a time. And why can't I sleep, you ask? Quite simple, really; I'm too drunk.

apparently this is old as fuck: kate from kate's playground has a hoof?|amp [http://web.archive.org/web/20050801005256/http://amplovesyou.net/]}}
