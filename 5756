'''Nick Clegg''', the "[[quasidan|stud monkey]] of [[london|Parliament]]" [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Karengillan2.jpg], is the leader of the Liberal and Social Democrat party of the [[britfag|UK]], and has brought sex into British [[politics]] [[truth|for the first time]] since the tragic death of the MP and part time supermodel, The Right Honourable Mo Mowlam (18 December 1949- 19 August 2005.

As a [[16-year-old]] exchange student in Munich, [[Germany]], he performed community service for a minor case of [[fire|arson]]: he and a girlfriend attempted to smoke Germany's leading collection of [[mexico|cacti]] belonging to a [[marijuana|professor]], in the mistaken belief that they were [[lsd|hallucinogenic]], something which he said he was "not proud" of, when it re-emerged during his time as LSD Home Affairs spokesman [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1193693/Id-drunk-I-irresponsible-Criminal-Nick-Clegg-regrets.html].  His Dutch mother Hermance van den [[drug|Baked]] was a hippy with special drug needs who had been interned as a girl with her family by the [[stoner|Amsterdam police]], who were quoted as saying "de vrouw was harshing mijn [[jamaica|buzz]], man". His great-great-great-great aunt was the writer Baroness Mora [[drug|Budsmoke]], who liked to share [[bestiality|horse cock]] with Catherine the [[vagina|Great]] [http://europeanhistory.about.com/od/catherinethegreat/a/histmyths1.htm].

Clegg first sprung to attention on the popluar British [[pron]] soap "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lastofthesummerwine/ Last Of The Summer Wine]" and then went onto to achieve a nomination for his local [[Charles Manson|LSD coven]] by allowing his [[penis|12' pink torpedo]] to swing about during a spirited rendition of "Stay on the scene, (get on up), like a sex machine." In an article in [[Women]]'s Weekly Clegg claimed to have had 'the sexy time' with 'no more' than 9000 women [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583465/Nick-Clegg-has-had-sex-with-no-more-than-30.html]. In a no-holds-barred interview involving handcuffs and babyoil, Clegg recalled being "pretty gobsmacked" on first meeting a [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Bushy_pubic.jpg Spanish senator's daughter] when they were both studying in [[wales|Belgium]]. "You haven't lived until you've eaten three day old paella out of a senorita's [[pubic]] bush," he said. "It's fish heaven." After first mistakenly wooing her in [[French]], he learnt to speak [[Spanish]] 'for her sake' (although [[some argue|cynics]] say he was merely shouting in [[English]] and putting "O" on the ends of words). "It was then I realised that I wanted to [[anal|pound as deeply into]] the European Community as I could," purred Clegg, [[oil]]ing his torso.

==Sex And Drugs And A Fairer Voting System For All==

Having deposed previous leaders of the LSD - [[scotland|Sir Charles Kennedy]] over an addiction scandal and [[old|Sir Menzies-The-Newagents]] over a viagra scandal - Clegg has gradually [[sex|laid down]] a bedrock support amoung women of 15-30, personally signing the perter pairs of [[tits|love pillows]] with a felt pen and donating a special [[cum|protein drink]] from his boy [[sausage]] to the most [[tits|nubile]].

==The Man, The Policies, The 12 Inch Cock==
[[File:Monster-cock4.jpg|thumb|Clegg crosses swords at Prime Minister's Question Time]]
Swinging himself around like Ninja out of [[Die Antwoord]], Clegg recently "won" a debate against David "[[David Cameron|Dave]]" Cameron and [[Gordon Brown|a lump of wood in a suit]] from the Labour Party by promising to be the hard and thrusting vanguard of the progressive centre left.   Whilst doing a member of the audience doggie stylee Clegg vowed "The. LSD. Will. Be. The.Party. With. The. Strongest. Mandate.", before [[cum|coming]] in her hair.

Policies include;

*Get into Euorpe's frilly [[panties]]
*Free [[drug]]s on the NHS
*Withdraw from [[Afghanistan]] before it gets pregnant
*Cock block the  [[America]]ns whenever possible
*Raise community pride with games of [[George Osborne|salty biscuit]]
*Legalise [[hippy|Donovon]]
*Legalise public nudity for [[Felicia Day|attractive people]]
*Bring back the miniskirt for non-[[fat]] female police officers between 18-25 [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:Karengillan2.jpg].
*Pay off the [[money|National Debt]] by forcing [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] to devolve from England
*One [[man]], one vote

===Anna Span===

Clegg has encouraged [[whore|porn actresses]] to star as LSD MPs, saying of the latest - Anna Span - that "she cares passionately about her [[vagina|area]]" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Span#United_Kingdom_general_election.2C_2010].  The LSD have set up a special site featuring the best of Miss Span's work [http://annaspansdiary.com/] and plans to feature her and Nick in a special Election Night "[[love]] film".
