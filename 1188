Brookers
[[Image:Brookers_whos_in_box_001.jpg |frame|A tribute to [[DaxFlame]] in [[asspie]] mode]]
'''Brookers''' is an e-celebrity/vlogger/unfunny amateur filmmaker from [[YouTube]] who [[Britney Spears|couldn't handle all the fame and went batshit insane]].  She claims to be the first performer to have been discovered on the YouTube website that was offered a contract from the mainstream media.  It went absolutely [[fail|nowhere]]. She began posting her short "comedic" videos on YouTube in September 2005. By June 2006, the videos earned her an 18-month development contract from [[Carson Daly]].  Later, the contract expired without renewal once [[unrealistic expectations|NBC Universal]] realized she was [[unfunny|not as funny]] as [[unwarranted self-importance|1960s-influenced, tiresome, elitist,]] and [[Homosexuality|gay]] shows such as [[old media|Lost]], [[old media|My Name is Earl]], and [[old media|The Office]].

== The Beginning ==
[[Image:Brookers.PNG|thumb|The result of cross-breeding a gopher and a [[cunt]].]]
Brookers began her career as a horrible [[YouTube]] film maker quite suddenly.  She was just having a normal life in Holden, Massachusetts as a 99 Restaurant [[slut|hostess]] living at her mom's house while cheating on her boyfriend with his best friend (the usual for Brooke). Then she posted some lame-ass videos, according to Brookers, to entertain her friends and family. Initially, she would get pissed off seeing these people commenting on her public "private" videos. Then she became famous by leaping on the [[Numa Numa]] bandwagon and making yet another [[Numa Numa|Numa]] video that was badly disguised as a parody of the entire craze. This got the attention of not only a bunch of sex-starved nerds who were excited by seeing her [[rape|molesting]] a standup cutout figure of [[LOTR|Legolas]], but also a few famous people who started sending her money to do more videos. This created problems, because she is too retarded to count all that money, and too ignorant to realize she could just get a [[kike]] or [[azns|azn]] to do it for her.

== The "Fame" ==

For some reason, everyone and their brother decided that Brookers was the most amazingly talented filmmaker on the [[Internets]] and everyone began sending her lots and lots of money for [[drug|her expansive cocaine habit]] in hopes of being noticed and getting the chance to [[sex|bang]] her. But suddenly, she thought that people just saw her as some Internet deity rather than an easy lay.  Brookers posted a whiny vlog about how she is a human being with feelings and stuff, and how much she has suffered from having to count all of that money. [[drama|Poor, poor thing]]. Also, her [[fapping|lonely]] [[lusers|fans]] sent her money with which to buy a car after she set up a car fund.  After she received the money to buy a car, all she did was complain that she was [[unwarranted self-importance|forced to buy a way too expensive car for herself]].  Currently she is in the progress of selling that very car to keep the money for her own [[hookers and blow|personal use]].

[[Image:Brookers-ASC.jpg|thumb|right|Even more awkward. And why the fuck does she look like the Rod Stewart of the 1970s?]]
[[Image:Microbepara.jpg|thumb|right|A public photo he shared on his myspace lol and he sure looks [[Scottish]] to me.]]
Now since Brooke has been living in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] she has since declared herself [[fake bisexual|bisexual]]. This would make people wonder if her current boyfriend Benjamin Lindemuth-McRobie, who works in film production with [[IMDb]] credits, has a [[cunt|vagina]].  No one can confirm or deny this at the present time but since no one really cares about her [[slut|career path to fame]] we'll never know (nor care to). It is quite funny how Brooke's last serious boyfriend was named '''Ben'''.  If she calls out the wrong name, due to her horrible memory, in bed then she won't have a problem.  Although she doesnt seem too committed to him because on her public facebook and myspace she continuously advertises herself as single.  She also does not live anywhere near Ben and chooses to live on the East coast and only have a relationship when it is convenient for her.  She also has been working on a shitacular movie called "rounddabout" which involves Giuseppe Pugliese (Joseph Rhodes) whom she ran off and lived with after getting kicked out of her house back in the day.  Long story short: she had a relationship with him and he fell in love with her and now that they are back "working" together their have been rumors of revival of feelings and acting upon them.

What is actually quite hilarious is how pretty much all of her ex boyfriends have moved on to younger and prettier girls that don't have a grand canyon in their mouths.  The guys like to move on from her worn out and '''floppy cunt''', but she just obsesses over them until she finds another guy with an STD that she can add to her collection.

Also, ever since Brooke has become "famous" she has been nervous of stalkers tracking her down in her small town of Holden, Massachusetts.  At first she was afraid to leave her home at 5 Ridgewood Rd!!

'''UPDATE:'''
Brooke was a dumb bitch and left her macbook in a orange cab in California.  Now she lost her laptop and cannot find who has it.  Expect the person that found it to post her nasty nude pictures of her performing scat acts.  Whatever reward Brooke has for her lost macbook anon will double.

Anon broke into her car by smashing in her window and then stole her shitty GPS.  Stupid blonde women shouldn't be driving anyways.

Brooke's home is in Holden at 5 Ridgewood Rd.  Zip code 01520. But now she is living in New York City where she pays her rent by prostituting herself on the streets. [correction - Brooke's lease ran out and her roomates hated living with her so much that she couldn't stay in NYC, so she moved back to her home in Holden.  And since she has no friends or anything to do there she will probably be making more shitty videos.]

== The E-War ==
When Brookers made a vlog called '''"Hi my name is...?"''', a shitty video in which she cries about how jealous she is of her friends (because they have to flip burgers to get minimum wage money), shit went down. Totally-unknown e-celebs Knox, [[Jason Steele]], and Matt Books started an anti-Brookers campaign upon Pootube, and every single 13-year-old Knoxfag made a lame "Brookers Sucks" video for the lulz. The Knox-Jason-Matt trio also reviewed her ass-tacular script "Roundabout," which was full of forced emotion, heroin, boring cursing, and fail. Perhaps it was more amazing than given credit for though since it's a massive revelation of her future. Brookers has often said that she sees the future events of her life coming before they occur.

== Brookers' Lonely Fans ==
[[Image:Acquaintance.gif|thumb|right|What an acquaintance of hers had to say about her.]]
Brookers' fans all want to rape the shit out of her. Every single one of them. They are very desperate young and middle-aged [[virgins|men]] who suck up to her videos in puke-inducing comments. It is funny because half the time they can't tell the difference between her and her sister Missy (which shows how much they really care about Brooke)

You speak from your heart and have experienced your 15 minutes of fame so to speak from exposure of a modern method, the internet driven by youtube.

You sound like you have some regrets! You're so young to be so deep.

Enjoy the gift of life and don't be so serious. Don't be so hard on yourself!

You're a great kid, Brooke!

I'll tutor you in Math if you wish!
