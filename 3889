ISCABBS
'''[http://www.googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=ISCABBS&word2=%22ISCA+BBS%22 ISCABBS]''' is a text-based [[Citadel]] [[BBS]] which laid the groundwork for an unbelievable about of Internets [[drama]] well before the invention of Web 1.0.  Much like Lucy, the common ancestor of [[man]], ISCABBS has a relatively unevolved and crude form but a strongly developed capacity for drama generation.

ISCA came online about 1990 and had descended into all-consuming [[faggotry]] by 1991.  Due to the overwhelming and persistent [[retard]]edness of the [[admin]], many spinoff boards have been created.  The latest, [[Inara BBS]] (a board for [[retard|"short bus"]] users and neo-[[nazis]]) was created in September 2006.

ISCA users meet yearly for a ritual [[fat]] [[nerd]] [[orgy]] known as the ISCAnic.  Highlights include when [[Shuunka Tanka]], a resident "[[zoophile]] activist," brought his trained donkey to the 'nic where it immediately started trying to hump the attendees at random ([[pix plz]]).  This IRL drama was the culmination of much early 90s [[bestiality]] drama on the BBS itself.

Well, I've been absent from ASBest for a month or three. I return
to see some politicking going on--and some new faces. I like new
faces--I found a few on ISCA, including an anon who calls himself
Equuinox. He is a good fellow.

*******ISCA BBS******
I've spent a great deal of time on there the last few months,
doing my bit of crusading for zoophilia. I was completely open to anyone
on the BBS and got more than one flame as well as more than one "Don't
tell anyone but once--" I also have picked up more than one
friend--enough that whenever someone flamed me in an public forum that
others would jump to my rescue.

It was also nice that I've been able to help a few zoos on there
come to terms with their sexuality--and this goes to Hoss
Topper--a question--Just how in the heck do I succor a zoo who also
happens to be Christian, devout Christian about, what she's done? </pre>
