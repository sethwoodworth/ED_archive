[[Image:Cyde Weys.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Fact:''' Cyde Weys a ton.]]
'''Cyde Weys''', or simply '''''Cyde''''',  is a pseudonym of '''Benjamin McIlwain''' living in Potomac, Maryland. Cyde is a [[fat]] [[Wikipedia]] [[luser|undergraduate]] [[bureaucratic fuck|admin]], best known for being the responsible of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_13 the Great Anti Userbox Rampage][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_14 of May 2006], along his [[fucktard|pseudo-intellectual]] [[e-pals|friends]] [[Tony Sidaway]] and  [[Sockpuppet|Conrad Devonshire]].

==Origins==
Cyde did not have it easy as a [[13-year-old boy|little boy]]. He was rejected by all the [[16-year-old girl|girls]] because of his [[fat|physical impediment]], although he did find redemption in [[Pizza and beer|macrobiotic food]], [[Science fiction|top notch entertainment]], and, of course, [[masturbation|meditation]]. When he was 16, [[some argue]] he tried getting infected with [[teh]] [[ghey]], but his [[ass]] was so damn huge not even [[gay boys]] wanted anything to do with it.

[[Noone]] [[love|loved]] him. Not even [[God]], because [[God hates fags|god hates fats]].

What was Cyde supposed to do?

==The College Years==
College life gave Cyde a chance to start anew and that he did, as the largest porn distributor on the campus file sharing hub.  At its peak, his collection was [[over 9000]] gigabytes ([[srsly]]) with 90% of it being scat, dog farts, and amputee.  The other 10% was [[shotacon]], so you have to give the guy some credit.  For the first time in his life Cyde felt loved and appreciated, but began to crave more and soon turned to IP spoofing in order to increase his distribution bandwidth and block rival distributors.

The hub admin caught on to his shenanigans but couldn’t pinpoint Cyde’s real address, so he banned Cyde’s entire community block of 1,500 people and put his IRL info on the ban message.  The university had to step in to protect Cyde after wanted posters were placed all over campus.  Faced with losing his adoring public, Cyde did the only thing he knew how to do: spoofed the university’s DHCP system to get around the community ban.

The university’s IT department caught on to his shenanigans but couldn’t pinpoint Cyde’s real address immediately, so they freaked out and blocked all internet and network access for the community block for a few hours.  Monitored 24/7 by university IT and hated by the entire student body, Cyde’s dream of a new life had been crushed like everything else his gigantic ass touched.

==Enter [[Wikipedia]]==
[[Image:Cyde_is_God.JPG|thumb|[[Unwarranted self-importance]] from [[User talk:Cyde Weys|here]]]]
It was then that Cyde, upon one [[basement dweller|busy]] night after a [[roman shower|frat party]], discovered the [[Goatse|wonderful world of Wikipedia]].

[[Allegedly]], this was the first step towards [[Apocalypse|the end of the lulz]].

Cyde [[fellatio|worked his way up]] to adminship by [[fuck|befriending]] [[Jimbo Wales]] and the rest of the [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|fucktards]], and he was finally granted the [[myth|mythical]] [[banhammer]]. Since it's [[common knowledge]] that the requisites for being a [[Wikipedia admin]] are being [[fugly]], a [[transsexual]] (see [[Tony Sidaway]] and [[Kelly Martin]]), and/or [[batshit insane]] (see [[MONGO]]), it was obvious that his lonely childhood had left him [[emo|scarred for life]]. By becoming an admin at the greatest page [[not|eva]], as [[e-psychiatrist]]s have determined, Cyde obtained [[Bible|biblical]] amounts of [[unwarranted self importance]] and [[bitch|divine rights]] over every single other user in not only Wikipedia, but [[Internets|the Internets]] itself. Such is the fate of a [[Wikipedophile]] admin&mdash; one who forgets that being on a special [[elite]] does not erase prior fucktardery.
[[Image:Seriousbusiness2.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Cyde's most profound belief EVA]]
In [[fact]] so much [[cum|power]] this adminship means to him, that it seems to be the ''only'' trait worth of recognition according to his user page, which goes like this:

"''I am an '''[[God|administrator]]''' on Wikipedia. I'm mostly interested in anything having to do with [[science]], including but not limited to, [[evolution]], [[IRC|encryption]], [[e-celebrity|astronomy]], [[geek|science fiction]], [[wtf|SETI]], and [[pr0n|computer programming]]. I'm also interested in [[W|politics]], mostly because of the [[funny|negative]] influence on [[cock|science]] it's been having lately. I am an unabashed [[arborphilia|naturalist]].''"

Needless to say, [[drama]] soon followed.

==The Great Userbox Drama==
[[Image:Wiki.png|thumb|No [[lulz]] ever again]]
Since Cyde never [[sex|knew what was it like to be happy]], he lashes out on the entire Wikipedia community. Nobody in Wikipedia is supposed to laugh, according to the policies [[WP:DNLAED]], [[In the ass|WP:ITA]], [[Cock|WP:DICK]], [[Lmaonade|WP:LMAO]], and [[Lollercaust|WP:CNSPIRCY]], [[TOS|official policies]] Jimbo Wales (the equivalent of a [[fuck|fuckable]] [[God]] on a [[Wikipedophile]]'s [[A frank discussion of mental illness|mind]]) [[allegedly]] wrote himself -- although Cyde probably [[blackmail]]ed him into it, since Jimmy appears on every single picture ever seen of him [[lol|laughing like it's lulzcon]].

So it was just a matter of time until Cyde, between blocking [[ppl]] [[in the ass]] and [[deleting your livejournal|deleting their talk pages]] so they couldn't complain about it, noticed something.

Something terrible.

Something ''[[funny]]''.

[[Userboxes]].

These tiny little colored fellas gave [[vagina|joy]] and [[STD|fun]] to everybody in the green, [[Wang|bunny]]fied Wikipedian fields.

Of course, something ''had'' to be done, because in Cyde's mind, nobody is ever to have a [[queer]] [[old]] [[meme|good time]]. Because for him it was [[obvious]] that queer old good times have [[epic fail|tragic consequences]].

"[[The Internet Is Serious Business]]. There should be [[Something Awful#The Lolocaust|no lol ever again]]", thought Cyde. And indeed he did something. Something that [[Shit nobody cares about|would change Wikipedia forever]].

===What he did===
[[Image:Image-New Cyde.jpg|thumb|300px|A more recent shot of Cyde (far left), still proving he is very <s>phat</s> fat.]]
Instead of calmly doing [[shit]] like most Wikipedia admins try to, coming off as civilized and smart, Cyde went [[OMFG]] [[liek|LIEK]] [[What-EVER|TOTALLY]] [[Batshit|BATSHIT]] one mythical May the 13th, when he and his [[cybersex|special friend]] [[Sockpuppet|Conrad Devonshire]] nominated [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_13 every motherfucking single userbox they didn't like for deletion], despite the fact that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_13#Template:User_Rotary_Dial some of them were being used] in [[at least 100]] userpages.

This [[drama bomb]] continued, much to the amazement of everybody, and by May the 14th, Cyde and his buddy had already nominated [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_14 a grand fucking total of 88 userboxes to deletion], based on these main three claims:

* "''[[Uncyclopedia|Unencyclopedic]]'' template, does not belong in template space. Opinions like "Oh but it's [[lollercoaster|funny]]" are irrelevant, as humor is [[Albert Einstein|relative]], but our [[Quasidan's penis|encyclopedic goals]] are not." - Cyde Weys.
* ''Uncyclopededic'' template, simply [[unfunny|not funny]], no point in [[circle jerk|having around]]. Get this [[crap|junk]] out of template space. - Cyde Weys.
* "Stupid and lacking in humor. Pointless to have around." - [[Sockpuppet|Conrad Devonshire]].

[[Image:1ee8Pl4WTw.jpg|thumb|Simply not funny, no point in having around]]

Mind you, some of them were nominated by Conrad and "speedy deleted" by Cyde in less than what it takes you to say [[MILF]]. Not to mention '''many''' userboxes were nominated without a deletion warning, thus preventing Wikipedia users from [[truth|knowing the truth]].

However, the truth WAS made public, and a [[drama|wave of outrage]] filled Wikipedia's userpages, where userboxes' warnings of deletion were screwing up the [[blog|designs]]. Soon afterwards ''thousands'' of "'''KEEP''' n [[stfu]] syde[[(sic)]] [[kplzthx]]" comments appeared on the deletion voting logs. Since most of Wikipedia users are not [[assholes]], with the exception of [[Wikipedia Admin Gallery|a select few]], most userboxes ''did'' survive Cyde's vendetta, thanks in large to an admin known as [[E-mail|Mailer]] [[Satan|Diablo]], who tried to [[salt the earth|end the madness]]. A few ones, however, fell victim to "speedy deletion" (i.e. nominate for deletion at April 1 8:00 pm, delete at April 1 ''7:59'' pm) by Cyde's [[e-penis|adminship]].

Thanks in large to the unity of [[lol]]some Wikipedians, the userbox fad stayed. Of course, Cyde kept on [[bitch|bitching]] so eventually userboxes stopped being templates, or something, but that's [[shit nobody cares about|another story]].


===The aftermath===
From the Great Userbox Drama comes the (by now) ancient  wikipedian song of the Bonfire Userbox:

[[Image:Userboxes.png|242px|thumb|Survivors of the cause]]
:Remember, remember, the thirteenth of May,
:the deletion of lulz and the box
:I know of no reason why the lolercaust of the box
:should ever be forgot.

:Cyde Weys, Cyde Weys,
:t'was his intent
:To speedy delete up the lulz and the lol
:A suckpuppet and a [[Kelly Martin|tranny]] below,
:poor old Wikipedia's lulz to overthrow!
:By [[The Man|God's]] providence he was stopp'd,
:With a black person [[cock|carrot]] and a [[banhammer]] [[in the ass|in the belows]].

:Holloa boys, Holloa boys, let him be a [[cunt]].
:Holloa boys, Holloa boys, [[God]] save the [[lulz]]!

:Hip hip Hoorah!
:Hip hip Hoorah!

[[British]] Wikipedia users celebrate the 13th of May by [[flame war|burning an effigy]] of Cyde Weys with a stash of [[Tony Sidaway|faggots]].

==Other Drama-Generating Techniques==
Cyde's attempt at "serious lulz" (the "serious" here being [[unfunny]]) is something called [[List of Terms Referring to a Woman's Period|Rouge Clinic]], but quite frankly, [[nobody gives a shit]]. Additionally, Cyde has written various [[TL;DR|essays]], such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyde/Don't_be_a_fucking_douchebag the Don't Be a Fucking Douchebag] ([[Irony]]!) reply he gives to anybody who doesn't agree with him.

==Userbox Generator==
Why would Cyde, the one who deletes all the userboxes, have a userbox generator? It is at [http://teamgamer.org/cgi-bin/wikiubx.pl his ugly website]. And his userboxes page is the page with the most userboxes on THE WHOLE WIKIPEDIA according to  Interiot's list.

His USERBOX page is here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyde/testboxen.

Why the hell would CYDE, the hater of userboxes, have a USERBOX GENERATOR? It really gets you wondering who Cyde really is....

==[[Controversy]]==
[[Some argue]] that Cyde Weys is nothing more than [[Tony Sidaway]]'s [[sockpuppet]]. This [[conspiracy]] theory is based on the fact that Cyde's full name is pronounced exactly like Tony's last name. Also because they work in teams of injustice - Cyde bans a [[internet poor|poor bitch]] and Tony deletes the poor bitch's talk page, contribs, and existence from the universe. [[Shit]], there's even a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cydebot Cydebot], further increasing the [[drama bomb]] range.

Also, hanging around with Tony Sidaway is already controversial, because [[srsly]], [[wtf]] [[mate]].

==Which one of the four is true?==
02:31, 21 August 2006 Cyde (Talk | contribs) blocked "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=block&user=&page=User%3ACYDE+SUCKS+JIMBO+SUCKS+SNOPAKE+IS+A+SLUT+SCEPTRE+IS+DEAD CYDE SUCKS JIMBO SUCKS SNOPAKE IS A SLUT SCEPTRE IS DEAD] (contribs)" with an expiry time of indefinite ('''Only one of the four is true, dumbass.''')

Which one of the four is true?????

==Moment of Brilliance==
Cyde showed that he's more than just a pretty face by banning [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Sweet+Blue+Water a probable puppet] of [[SlimVirgin|Slime Virgin]] setting off days of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive290#SlimVirgin.27s_sockpuppet.28s.29 massive drama].
