The '''NBC.com forums''' are a place where useless [[Old|middle aged]] [[MILF|housewives]] go to discuss the many happenings of their favourite [[Old_media|NBC]] soap operas. Prominent users include Michael Bennett and Wendy Thomson.

==Carson Daly and the RickRoll==
On 21 June, 2007 [[Carson Daly]] used the [[4chan]] meme [[Rickroll]] on his seldom watched late night talk show. As soon as the news of this reached /b/, [[Anonymous]] started a raid against the NBC forums. This was made especially easy as the NBC Forums have no wordfilters and very little and incompetent moderation. For some reason, the many housewives were [[offensive|offended]] that [[Anonymous]] had started filling up the message boards with [[Goatse]], [[Tubgirl]] and [[Desu]]. This raid succeeded in shutting down the NBC Forums for a short time on Friday morning, but by 2:15pm they were back up.
