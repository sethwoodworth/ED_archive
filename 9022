Wiigii!
{{aspergers}}
'''Wiigii!''' (Not to be confused with [[Weegee]]) is an internet community on [[IRC]] primarily focused on destroying the ''[[Transformers]]'' fandom and all that it entails. A known haven of [[Jews]] and [[pedophiles]], wiigii! sacrifices children nightly to satisfy the lusts of its god, Glen Hallit.

The word wiigii! was created by self-diagnosed [[Asperger's syndrome|Ass pie]] '''David “Walky” Willis''' in 1998 when he shat his pants one day and described the sounds it made in his underwear to his friends on IRC.

==History==

Wiigii! (originally called #tfu) was birthed due to the same sophomoric ignorance it claims to stand against today - to be specific, throwing [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/msg/6e10b720af925b1c hissy fits] over how to spell a ''[[Transformers]]'' toy. Wiigii! is totally above stupid [[fanboy]]ish idiot fights over dumb small things, except for when those stupid [[fanboy]]ish idiot fights are over something Wiigii! deems important. 

==Drama==
Drama ensued when the channel realized they had an actual girl in their midst and began [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/browse_frm/thread/618cb6d47e440c39?scoring=d&q=lv+hydra+trix+group:alt.toys.transformers fighting over her]. Once the retainer dust settled, a clear “winner” for Trixter’s heart, '''LV!''', emerged, and immediately became a complete dick to everyone else. This included [[user:Hooper X|Hooper_X]], who cried like a little bitch when LV! made fun of his incredibly lame [[fanfic]].  This culminated in LV! being kicked from the channel.  The drama spilled [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.toys.transformers/browse_frm/thread/1e7042e24342b20f/36f21d7f36e7dd20#36f21d7f36e7dd20 onto the internets], where absolutely no one else cared, but they still talked about it for weeks.

Over time, everyone in the group eventually realized they were much better than everyone else, and left one-by-one for a new group - but in the course of doing so, they merely reconstituted the old group (#tfu) into a new group (#wiigii!), exactly the same as the first (LV! included).  Thankfully, this got the whole Superiority Amongst The Group thing out of their systems, and Wiigii! was able to finally devote their concentrated efforts on the whole [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|Superiority Amongst Everyone Else thing]].

==Behavior==

Wiigii! is so totally above stupid [[fanboy]]ish idiot' fights over dumb small things that they post everywhere on the Internet to engage in them.  And then when they are inevitably banned for trolling, they will whine on their [[LiveJournal]]s about how the place was full of [[fag]]s and they don't want to post there anyway.  Wiigii!ers will then spend inordinate amounts of time trying to sneak back in.  

It's largely known that Wiigii! is the only ''[[Transformers]]'' [[clique|community]] that knows everything and gets everything right, and also knows everything. And they get everything right. They may all be gay but they get everything right. They're also the only [[fan]]s who are funny, which they will repeatedly remind you. They have many doctors and scientists and Harvard graduates in their ranks, and Lord knows those kinds of people are never wrong ever. 

You can’t bring up a point of contention with a Wiigii!er (no matter how minor), because that Wiigii!er will call upon at least 100 of his friends to swarm around you and stalk you till your dying day (see [[Afterburner]]). Any reference made by ''Transformers'' fans to “inner circles” or “cliques” that are "ruining the fandom" is a poorly-veiled reference to Wiigii! and the evil they represent. Will Wiigii! ever come to an end? Never! They will continue steamrolling over their rivals and take over the world. When it is time for the [[Apocalypse]] all that remains will be Wiigii! carrying the flag for ignorant [[assholes]] and buttfucks everywhere! Oh, and Simon Furman for who they cannot live without.

==Wiigii's recent drama==

As of last Thursday wiigii is planning to sue the makers of the transformers comics for using green text in the background of one of their comics for which he claims to own copyright of (srly).Wiigii recently said that he'll settle out of court if they let him sniff Simon Furman's balls.
