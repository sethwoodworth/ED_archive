Fit

'''/fit/''' is the [[4chan]] fitness board and the worst board on the [[Internet]]. The rest of 4chan might be filled with [[Gay|homos]], [[B/|pedos]], [[K/|psychos]], [[B/|emos]], [[B/|necros]], [[B/|weirdos]], [[Robots|mofos]], [[Co/|bozos]], [[Anime|weabo(o)s]], [[Jews|jews]], [[Islam|muslims]], black person, [[B/|mexicans]] and the goddamn [[Plz|chinese]] but /fit/ eclipses all in terms of worthlessness and failure. Without a doubt it is a blackhole of life-sucking darkness and further proof that [[Hitler]] had it right with regards to what to do with retarded children. It is about the only board on 4chan to regularly fail to generate memes.

==Holy Goddamn Fuck, was it always like this?==
The simple answer to this question is that no, it was not always like this. When [[moot]] first stood /fit/ up it was a whole new world filled with hope and promise, inhabited by vagrants (mostly from /k/) who had stumbled across what seemed to be verdant fields of green filled with natives to rape and exploit for ruthlessly commercial purposes. The first three days consisted of fitness interested chantards optimisticly discussing such important things as diet and rep brackets for weightlifting. Most of the early adopters had at least a passing knowledge of the subject they were discussing, and a large number were cognizant of powerlifting and the sport of olympic weightlifting as well as High Intensity Interval Training and the Golden Age of Bodybuilding. After about three days the board even began to develope it's own memes, unaware at the time that one such meme would later grow to destroy them. But more on this later. The early memes of /fit/ consisted of pictures of eight-times Mr Olympia Ronnie Coleman, Public Enemy's Bring the Noise rewritten to become Bring the Squats, Electric Six's Dance Commander rewritten as Squat Commander and numerous others that are now lost in the bitter-tasting sands of time. It was about this time that the infamous ''OATZ!, SQUATZ!'' was born, carrying in it the power to destroy /fit/ forever.

==OATZ! SQUATZ!==
Soon /fit/'s three days of grace were over, and a steady trickle of rotten filth began to seep out of the dirty black rubbish bag in which the rest of [[4chan]]s dismembered corpse was slowly decomposing. At the time, the original dwellers of /fit/ (the founding fathers, if you would) were little concerned, as finally they had found kindred spirits in the barren [[Internet]] waste with who they could exchange ideas and play light-hearted, good-natured trolls on, to everyones mutual amusement and approval. This insidious filth first took the form of [[B/|fat, worthless bastards]] asking the same fucking questions again and again, questions like 'HAY /FIT/ HOW DOEZ I LOSE WEIGHTZ!!?' and 'LOL /FIT/Z WEIGHT HOW DOEZ I LOsE?!'. In order to spend as little time as possible on these [[B/|wastes of space]], the original inhabitants of the board began using the simple, throw-away advice of 'Eat oats and do squats.'. For fat fucks this was good, simple advice. While oats are not an especially great food source, they're a fairly good source of fiber and other nutrients, and in general make a worthwhile addition to the diet of your average American twinkie-eating fucktard. Squats are an extremely efficient strength building exercise and strengthening the legs has secondary cardio-vascular benefits, as the quadriceps assist the heart in pumping blood through the body and are more often than not ignored in the routines of many young men. Unfortunately, the new migrants began taking this advice far too seriously. Instead of a starting point for dietary changes, oats became an absolute cornerstone, an indispensable and unyielding Rock of Ages on which to base all other constructions, with their actual nutritional value becoming completely over-estimated and exaggerated. Squats became the be-all and end-all of any fitness routine. With rapacious rapidity 'Eat oats and do squats' became '''OATZ! SQUATZ!''', repeated ''ad nauseum'' like Seig Heil! in [[B/|Swedish gaybars]], by people with even less fitness knowledge than [[B/|/b/]] has good parenting skills. The end had begun. As of this moment it still hasn't finished, which indicates how fucking useless /fit/ actually is. Honestly you cunts finish what you started already.

==/fit/ Today==
For what felt like a century, /fit/ was seen as a tremendously worthless pile of shit. Between having a feud with [[fa|/fa/]] and dishing out obvious advice to newfags too stupid to use Google, it looked like /fit/ would get the ax at any moment. [[Last Thursday|Recently]], however, moot decided to do something beneficial for once and appointed mods and janitors who actually do their fucking jobs. A sticky was made which contains general fitness knowledge along with anon's daily recommended dose of [[banhammer]] should they ignore it and ask stupid questions.

Not all is perfect in /fit/, though. The board still produces less memes or OC than any other board with their only "noteworthy" one being Alpha as Fuck. /fit/izens also have developed an [[gay|unhealthy]] obsession with various bodybuilders and models such as [[Zyzz]], justifying their views with the quip [[lie|no homo]].

All is not lost, however. With a new batch of mods on the way there is a chance /fit/ could be cleaned up and [[unrealistic expectations|restored to its former glory]].
