==Purpose==

[[Image:Halbreich interface.jpg|thumb]]Halbreich.exe is a PC-only tool to speed up the laborious task of adding wiki-tags to articles. It was originally created for the Image Halbreich team to deal with the large numbers of uncategorized images, but can be easily customized to add wiki-tags of any kind.

==Installation==

====Minimal====

Unzip just these two files into the same folder

* halbreich\halbreich.exe	- the program itself
* halbreich\categories.lst	- the category list (you can edit this in notepad)
* halbreich\templates.lst	- the templates list (you can edit this in notepad)

===Full===

Unzip all files into the same folder.

* halbreich\readme.txt		- Documentation

* halbreich\halbreich.exe	- the program itself
* halbreich\categories.lst	- the category list (you can edit this in notepad)
* halbreich\templates.lst	- the templates list (you can edit this in notepad)

* halbreich\src\halbreich.ahk	- Halbreich Autohotkey source code
* halbreich\src\halbreich.ico	- icon for use with the AHK2EXE compiler

==Basic Workflow==

* '''IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT EXPERT MODE IS, LEAVE IT OFF, NOOB!!!!'''

# Open wiki page for editing with the internal browser editor
# Select tags from the list (see below)
# Move the text cursor to where you want the tags inserted into the wiki page.
# Press CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste the tags.

==Selecting Tags==

* You can toggle the checkboxes beside a tag to select it.
* To search for a tag, type a portion of the tag's name in the bottom text field of Halbreich's interface. Pressing ENTER will toggle the last tag found that includes that text.
* Deselect tags with the ESC key (Halbreich must be the foreground app)
*'''note:''' Tags that begin with a backslash "\" will not be inserted during a tag-paste. This is intentional.

==Rapid Tagging==

* Once again, it must be stressed that '''IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT EXPERT MODE IS, LEAVE IT OFF, NOOB!!!!'''
* Rapid tagging is accomplished by turning on the '''EXPERT''' checkbox or hitting ALT+X while Halbreich is the foreground app.
* When you hit CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste tags, it will paste the tags, then auto-TAB you to the Summary field, auto-paste the tags into that summary field, and hit ENTER to submit the changes automatically.
* If your text cursor isn't carefully placed when you perform an expert paste, it will probably fuck things up. Because YOU fucked it up. Idiot.
* It's there for people who have to categorize and tag shitloads of docs and images who know what they're doing. Use with caution!

==Tag Files==

* On startup, Halbreich will search the directory for *.lst taglists
* tag lists can be edited in notepad. One tag per line.
* tag lists show up in the topmost dropdown gadget
* you can create a '''default.lst''' file to be selected on Halbreich's startup.

==To Do==
