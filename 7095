'''Read the Fucking Manual''' is close kin of the phrase [[lurk moar]]. '''RTFM''' refers to the manual pages (or "man" pages, after the command used to display them) contained in [[*nix]] variants and has come to refer to any help pages or FAQs. Typically used as a reponse on mailing lists and in [[chat rooms]] when a [[newbie]] asks questions for which the answers are readily available from other sources. Even then, some people are too retarded to bother. It is expected that if you want to play in places like [[BSD|misc@openbsd]] that you have already done your homework.
 
While the word "read" is a verb, the entire acronym is often used as a verb as well. Ex. 

 <nowiki><n00b>How do I set up pf to do ALTQ?</nowiki>
 <nowiki><Theo>Dumbass, man it. </nowiki>
 <nowiki><n00b>omg, *cry*</nowiki>
 <nowiki><Theo>You're lucky all I did was RTFM you.</nowiki>
 <nowiki>*Theo sets mode : +b *!n00b@*</nowiki>
