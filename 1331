[[You]] know how it feels.
# You're on an [[internet]] forum, some [[newfag]] makes a post, you elaborate on it by stating something really fucking obvious. You get a shitload of replies saying "'''Captain Obvious''' is obvious." You [[emo|go cry]].
# When someone posts something that is [[retard|fucking obvious]], you can't help but [[facepalm]]. And if you're a real [[faggot]], you'll call them '''Captain Obvious''', but [[irony|ironically]] you are being obvious at the same time.

Being an internet [[meme]] and an [[IRL]] meme at the same time, Captain Obvious can't help but feel glorious. The original edition of Captain Obvious (pictured right) shows him as a rip off of Superman and the [[KFC]] mascot fused together. However, some faggots, such as [[Uncyclopedia]] believe him to be a rip-off of [[Batman]]. Because he's so old it's hard to tell, but since [[Uncyclopedia]] has [[down syndrome]], it's fucking obvious we're right.

Should you be [[trolled]] by a faggot who decides to point out you are being obvious, take it upon yourself to reach through your computer screen and [[bitch]] slap them. They deserve it. Give yourself one too for being fucking obvious.

Should you encounter a Captain Obvious, do the right thing and [[hack]] his [[IP]], cover his [[MySpace]] with [[CP]] and report him to the [[FBI]]. Many [[lulz]] will be generated from this. Alternatively, you could pretend to be a [[Delicious cake|delicious]] [[loli]] and lure [[Pedophile|him]] to your house. Once he finds out your a grown man, much [[frustration]] will be had by him. However, he might try to [[rape]] [[Sick fuck|you anyway]] [[A cat is fine too|to make up for the lack of sweet 10-year-old female pussy]].
