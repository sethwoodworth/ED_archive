MeatballWiki
{{needsmore|links and a [[shoop]]ed barnstar or two}}
[[Image:Meatballlogo.gif‎|right|The DMCA-protected logo of MeatballWiki]]
Meatballwiki was founded by some [[India]]n (the [[whine]]y kind from [[Asia]]) by the name of [[JFK|Sirhan Sirhan]] ([[Meatball:SunirShah|his name page]]) and some [[otherkin]] [[white]]y with [[Meatball:CliffordAdams|a more forgettable name]]. They presented the site as a [[1337]] metawiki (translation from [[wikipedese]]: theoretical [[wiki]] for wiki and server [[sysop]]s of wiki sites). This was a [[Longcat|loooonnnggg]] time ago (1998), years before the [[Wikipedia]], [[WMF]], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Metawiki] even existed, so they get one of eight endorsements from [[Wikiwikiweb|the very first wiki]] as a real wiki and not a wikiclone (cheap and corrupt shit like the [[Mediawiki]] this site runs on).  

Meatball may well be the most [[tl;dr]] wiki of all, but it does have a '''very''' few good articles if you like reading [[serious business|srs biz]]. The site got stuck at around 4,000. Lately, they've had fewer contributions per day (averaging less than 1.5, less than 1 if you don't count welcome messages to the occasional wikipedo) than [[Encyc.org]]. Meatball still wins here because encyc contributions are always [[Batshit insane|monomaniacal]] spurts by one user at a time. 

If anyone is still alive at Meatballwiki, he or she should make an article to analyze encyc.org as a case of creative dysfunctionality. 

Meatball requires [[powerword|real names]] (except from [[transsexuals|trannies]] and [[jews]], both encouraged to use their stage names), with limited exceptions for [[IP address]]es. Whether anyone there is ever wide-enough awake to check what happens on the site is another question. The rules ([[IP]] or [[powerword]]&mdash;[[meatball:UseRealNames|the main article]]) are among the most [[tl;dr]] things you will ever encounter. With no [[profit]] and not much recent activity, the [[Wikipedia Jews|wikipedia jew]]s never even seriously attempted to take over. Any EDiot is free to make an account there under his or her [[powerword]], hell it should be possible with any bullshit. 

{{quote|Hello my name is Fuckface Amadeus and my parents gave me this strange name to force me to face the cruelties of the world. I am also rilly [[Grawp]]'s many user names on encyc.org and my only ambition is to talk bullshit wikisociology.|No resemblance to living or dead, just a hypothetical for Meatball signup}}

It's probably too late for this [[dead|fossil]] site. A dissection of the pathology of ED by Meatball (one mention but no links now) might also make a nice article before Meatball breathes its [[death|final breath]].

== Content ==
The kind of people Meatball attracts ('''HEY Y'ALL [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|IMMA]] REALLY FUCKIN' INNELEKCHURL ABOUT UR WIKIS''') cause terrible [[fail]] on most pages. Along with the overload of pseud-crap (sociology of teh new Electronic Frontier) dumped by Meatballers, the site does have a couple of articles that describe typical TOW phenomena so accurately as to make [[Bureaucratic Fucks|TOW admins]] get queasy. 

=== Meatball Infected Mediawiki ===
Meatball makes a claim (which most of their newer users don't seem to respect) to being a [[Meatball:BarnRaising| "barn-raising" community]] (you set up a homestead and we'll all rush in to kill the natives an' help set up yaw barn!). Yee hawww!, nice metaphor for [[IRL]] [[Internet]] history.
 
====Barnstars====
[[Image:Barnstar in box from yard sale.jpg|frame|The architectural support type of barnstar, in a box of other junk from the yard sale.]]
This is how Meatballwiki became responsible for the evil and ugly [[barnstar]] phenomenon. Meatball introduced this [[fail]] and manipulative piece of shit to the world just so that [[bureaucratic fucks|TOW admins]] could later rub it into people's faces. Except for their DMCA-protected logo, the barnstars seem to be the only set of pictures on the site. Some guy pretending to be [[Chinese]] uploaded a better version of the barnstar a few years after Meatball started. 

Their article on [[Meatball:BarnStar|barnstars]] does cover some interesting variants on [[TOW]]'s (and their own) cheap [[barnstar|lovebomb]]ing concept.

[[Wikipedo]]es have a typical take on this. '''Their''' official version (decorative on the door) is real but [[OMG]] the architectural support one might be real but [[wikipedia:Barnstar#Other star-shaped plates| is not ours so it's not really real and it's sure not a barnstar!!1!]]. Arse over backwards? 

===Meatballer's Best Article ([[Meatball:GoodBye|Goodbye]])===
MeatBallWiki's great triumph is a discussion of [[wikicide]]. [[Tl;dr]], but it does go into lovely detail on the TOW admin pastime of faking wikideath to get the worst toadies begging ''oh, baby, please come back, it is just wikideath to be without [[you]]''. The accuracy of this article causes great [[butthurt]] among the TOW types with their habitual wikicides and constant permission for [[drama]]tically wikicided admins to [[sock]] their way back into the fold. Unfortunately, [[ED]] is no longer immune to this phenomenon. Several drama queens have recently pulled the same ploy and got the same kind of [[Hugbox|mollycoddling]].

===Meatball Wiki's Wikibus Tour===
Meatball hosts the [[meatball:TourBusMap|wiki tour bus]] so you can visit more defunct wikis and even [[TOW]].

=== Articles with a Good Line or Two===
All seriously [[tl;dr]], Meatbawl articles sometimes have good lines and things worth thinking about or remembering.

[[meatball:KnowItAll|Know It All]] makes some good points about the Internet enabling know-nothings to pose as know-it-alls.

[[meatball:TheSeptemberThatNeverEnded| The September that never ended]] is a defunct phenomenon now that just about everyone has pre-college [[Internet]] access, but the article has some interesting true history.

=== Typical crap ===
Most of the site is typical crap.

=== Unusually whiny ===
Meatballer number 1 Sirhan Sirhan is an upper-caste [[India]]n, so bears the usual hypocritical grudge against [[white people]]. His voice enters  the higher register with this [[whine]]: [[Meatball:TheUnbearableWhitenessofBeing|TheUnbearableWhitenessofBeing]]. 

== Structure ==
Like the [[Wikiwikiweb|WikiWikiWeb]], the best technical thing about this site for a newbie is the reminder that wikis neither started nor finished with [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Metawiki] and the [[WMF]]; Meatball also has a couple of readable technical articles about logic and programming mixed in with the overload of pseud-bullshit and the occasional pithy observations.

Also like the Wikiwikiweb, everything is flat and there is no distinction between discussion, article, and user-name pages. Most of the "articles" look exactly like [[lame]] discussion pages. Oh surprising, they are all the same. A few more parts are locally cached (like Recent Changes) than on the Wikiwikiweb. 

==Drama and E-enemies of Meatballwiki==
=== Fermentwiki === 
[[Image:Fermentwikilogo.png|left|thumb|Logo of ferment wiki, people after our own hearts!]]
[[Image:Fermentwikifrontpage.PNG |thumb|Old ferment wiki front page, proof (75).]]
Fermentwiki was founded in 2002 as the grand adversary of Meatballwiki. The flame that burns half as long may well be twice as bright, but Fermentwiki shut down in early 2005. Barely remembered now, its enmity with Meatballwiki lives on in the minds of a few Meatballers. 
The dispute was over licensing, the right to fork (set up a new copy of the content and let it run from there), and the right to pseudonymity (Fermentwiki supported it). Fermentwiki collapsed under a load of [[spam]] because they never had enough users to check recent changes, never had enough articles to attract the critical number of users, and got attacked by fervent Meatballers (all now fervent wikipedoes). They do seem like a better crowd, perhaps some have been involved in ED.

===The Chinese Guy===
[[Image:Meatball rapid response.png|thumb|Wake up, OMG, a mention!!]]
The Chinese guy appears not to be Chinese (Xiong = John?). He made a better and more architecturally correct version of the barnstar, but upset some Meatbawlers. Sirhan Sirhan made an exception and accepted him using a pseudonym [[meatball:BarnStarInABox|
Barnstar in a box: Is it real or shooped?]].

===[[WMF]]===
The Wikimedia Foundation is an e-enemy of Meatball, or maybe Meatballers got so butthurt about being irrelevant that they became e-enemies of the WMF.

== Meatballwiki and the WMF ([[Wikipedia]] and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Metawiki]) ==
===Early days===
When [[Wikipedia|the evil Cthulhu of wikis]] was launched, two or three of the back-room types were into the Meatball wiki. 

===Getting sucky===
After Wikipedia started to get seriously bureaucratic (2005 to 2007?), some of the worst [[bureaucratic fucks]] with their [[POV|axen to grinden and pointen to pushen]] were attracted to the Meatball's treatment of the Internets as really fucking [[serious business|srs biz]]. [[Jossi]] and [[Kelly Martin]] are just two who are also fortunate to have articles here. On Meatball, wikipedoes would make an account, spew some pseud crap, then hold up their Meatball account as a badge of honour back on TOW. Begging for any semblance of life by this stage, Sirhan Sirhan and the one or two other Meatballers heartily welcomed all such [[cum|com]]ers, shit, they wanted them to stay long enough to be awarded [[barnstar|bastard]]s, but the wikipedoes always missed the [[drama]] and POV pushing on TOW too much, and didn't stick around. Most of these meatballing wikipedoes have been [[permaban]]ned from [[TOW]].

===Total suck===
Bureaucratic fucks  still join in at times; some are convinced that becoming a Meatballer grants them extra credit as wiki-[[retard|inneluctuals]]. [[Durova]] signed up to Meatball in 2009 ([[Meatball:LiseBroer|her name page]]). 

If you try to track the Wikipedo contributions you will find no drama, because Meatball (like the Wikiwikiweb) dumps the history (but not the logs) after two or so weeks. 

Butthurt over the Meatballwiki's [[wikicide]] article and the fact that they couldn't write "Hello world" in any language even with a textbook and two days to do it, the louder [[bureaucratic fuck]]s (IRL bureaucrats and lawyers) of today are seriously anti-Meatball. TOWer [[HighInBC]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:HighInBC user page]) had a [[butthurt|sore enough butt]] to make a typical "essay" and '''ALL FUCKING CAPS''' abbreviation pair [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTMEAT/ Wikipedia is not MeatballWiki or WP:NOTMEAT] on this.

{{Quote|[Meatball is] to the current Wikipedia what a Model-T is to a Lamborghini Murciélago.| HighInBC going nuts on a little power: oh shit, he's defunct now, too, no wait, it's a sham.}}

== Meatballwiki Now?==
Third-rate museum to enshrine the origin of the [[barnstar]]. Defunct as the site may be, it's still worth a look for EDiots who've only ever seen [[Mediawiki]] wikis, and to see the steps beyond the [[Wikiwikiweb|first wiki]]: more things cached, [[Meatball:IndexingScheme|and more ways of looking things up]].
