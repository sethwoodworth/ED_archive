[[Image:ShaqFu logo.png|thumb|Shaq's Big Challenge: try not to laugh]]

Shaq-Fu is a fighting game developed by [[EA]] and [[Fail|Delphine Software]] in 1994. It is based one the real life adventures of [[Lolwut|basketball legend]] and future [[Irish|Boston Celtic's]] player, Shaquille O'Neal. Much like an adult experiencing flashbacks of their traumatizing childhood such as witnessing a murder or being molested, Just saying "Shaq-Fu" can be associated with many things: disturbing, distraught, traumatizing, [[offended|offensive]], terrible, anally violating, depressing, epic facepalm, etc etc. On his second year in the NBA in the mid 90's, Shaq became a [[pretty cool guy]] and everybody worshiped him. Back then, Shaq put it in the hoop like slam and hear the crowd screaming out jam. You could not get away from Shaq, he was everywhere. He was whored by almost every company to do Pepsi, Shoe commercials, food, [[dildos]], and, get this, a fucking rapper! As an attempt to cash in on his success and milk his giant money squirting tits, some cock sucking shyster thought it would be a good idea to give him a record contract. From his first laughably shitty album entitled "Shaq-Fu", spawned a bloody c section abomination that would be Shaq-Fu, the video game with the most horrible controls you will ever find. Shaq-Fu will forever burn a scorching painful mark in both video game world and the careers of every person responsible for the creation of this game.

==Story==
The story begins as is, our [[faq|man]] Shaquille "Diesel" O'Neal is in [[Japan]] for a charity basketball game. He for some reason is skulking the streets of Japan laced with Pepsi advertisements at every corner and walks in to a do-jo and finds some old geezer who owns it. As the story begins, you should realize that you have just wasted 5 minutes of your life, decide to stop playing the game and never return. The old [[Azn|Asian]] man tells Shaq in an opium fueled high that Shaq is Jew and he must save some fag prince kid of another dimension and fuck up some mummy named Sett-Ra because Eygyptian mummies know martial arts. So Shaq, like the [[retard|smart guy of a giant]] he is, steps in to the closet and mysteriously has kung fu powers and his own fighting style which is dubbed [[Lolwut|"Shaqido"]], srsly. He steps in another world to fuck countless mediocre warriors such as a [[furfag]], a cyborg, a [[terrorist]] with swords, and other faggots that take order from a fucking mummy. You go around and fight enemies Street Fighter style, everybody is easily dispatched because of the AI. You then end up in the best plot twist ever to be conjured, '''SPOILER ALERT:YOU FIGHT THE OLD GUY FROM THE DO-JO AND THE BOY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SAVE!''' If that wasn't enough, you fight two more bitches to get to the end. Then you finally reach the [[Final Boss]] which is the mummy and he's hard as shit. After you defeat him, Shaq leaves [[Afghanistan|the crappy place]] with the boy and the old fuck as to head to the big charity game that Shaq's team will most likely loose because [[Truth|Shaq can't make a free throw for shit even if the world depended on it.]] 

[[Image:Shaq Fu-2.png|thumb|left| Protip: To win every match, simply back your opponent into a corner and keep tapping the kick button until you defeat him.]] 

[[Image:Shaq Fuboxart.jpg|thumb| This is the fabled box art, you can tell by the calligraphy and markings. Much like opening Pandora's Box, unboxing Shaq-Fu would bestow upon you with all the horrors of the world. Note the tagline "Come Get Yours!"]] 

'''Analysis''':
This game totally blows matinee penis. As mentioned, the controls are horrid and unplayable. Combos and Specials were possible, but because of the controls, all you could do is kick the shit out of your opponent to win. AI was also cheap as in lesser modes the opponents just stand there as opposed to the hard mode where your opponents pulled specials out of their ass every chance they had. Shaq-Fu was all just a marketing scheme to cash in on Shaquille O'Neal's success at the time having young fans beg their parents to buy them the latest Shaq-Crap. From CD's to a pile of garbage videogame to even two failure movies, Shaq-Disel did it all. While America was on it's knees to suckle his dong, he was reeping in the big bucks from all corners. Shaq was nothing more than a sell out that prostituted himself to literally every fucking company there was. Shaq-Fu (the album and videogame) was the
by product of the Shaq-Attack. Today, no one gives a shit about Shaq, he's popularity has gone down in the last decade and a half. When he's not on the court calling fouls or making terrible 3-pointers, he's doing Icy-Hot commercials. But Shaq-Fu has not been forgotten. It has left a legacy and shall remain for generations to come.

'''[[tl;dr]]''':
Shaq-Fu <s>sucks balls.</s> is the best game [[evar]], go play it.

==Meet The Cast==
[[bullshit|The character's are totally original]]

[[Image:ShaqFu.jpg|thumb|left|Shaqido lol]]

'''Shaquille O'Neal aka Shaq aka Shaq-Diesel aka Shaq-Attack aka Last name: Good Player, First name: Never was aka 7 foot retard''' - The star of the game because it wouldn't be Shaq-Fu without the athlete its named after. Basketball star turned to martial arts warrior by [[gay|stepping in and out of the closet]]. He is the chosen one to save the prince and kill the mummy. [[Street Fighter|He can do a special attack that is original and totally not the same as Ryu's Hydouken]] and is the master of [[fail|Shaqido]].

'''Rajah''' - Arabian warrior prince with swords that sucks the cock of the colonel. Looks like Aladin with a turban.

'''Kaori''' - a [[furry]] of the human-feline kind. The poor man's Cat-Woman, she was created by the developers to [[masturbate|stimulate]] the interest of the game to covert/overt furries everywhere. Provides for endless [[fapping]] for sick fucks [[13 year old boys]] who are curious to feel what its like to slip their dick into a [[cat]]. 

'''Mephis''' - Sett-Ra's helper. He's basically a green [[zombie]] wearing a hood with magic powers and shit. He uses his magic and studies ways on how to beat Shaq.

'''Auroch''' - as UrinatingTree once said in his Shaq-Fu review, "What happens when [[Mortal Kombat|Motaro]] rapes [[Street Fighter|Zangeif]]. He is the result of the rape and is also an [[aspie]].

'''Beast''' - some big red muscular skeleton that serves the mummy by orally.

'''Colonel''' - a high ranking offical who is a cyborg. Obviously a fag because of all that silver on him.

'''Voodoo''' - some hot chick with magical powers that is not Shaq's girlfriend. Like with the furry, the developers wanted to create an unoriginal woman so kids can jerk off to her.

'''Diesel''' - some weakling [[Azn]] who calls himself Diesel! HA! HA! HA! HA!

'''Leotsu''' - the old bastard who foretold Shaq's destiny and states that Shaq is the chosen one yet still fights him wtf!.

'''Nezu'''- the boy prince that Shaq is said to save yet fights him as well because the mummy made him his bitch wtf!.

'''Sett-Ra''' - the main villain and [[final boss]] of the game. He has magical powers (who doesn't) and is hellbent on taking over two worlds, one of them being [[IRL]]. All he is, a mummy with spiked shoulder pads. Originality is a loose word in this article isn't it?

==Shaq-Fu Search and Destroy Mission==
[[Image:Liberation4-3.jpg|thumb|The [[basement dwellers|guys]] gloating their hard day of searching for the only 4 copies of Shaq-Fu. They are not wearing any pants so they are gay.]]
Years after the travesty that was Shaq-Fu, the internet became full force and many victims of Shaqido united to talk about how much of a suck-fest Shaq-Fu was. One day a bunch of friends gathered for a weed and [[circle jerk]] session. While stroking each other, one of the fags had the bright idea. For some reason, fapping and getting fapped made him reminisce of the time he first played Shaq-Fu and all it's disappointing glory. He got the idea hey lets make a website dedicating to the locating and liberation of this spawn of facepalm. Thus, the website Shaqfu.com was born. Literally, these guys went around to local video game shops to search for the all the copies of Shaq-Fu. The mission was successful as they raided many GameStops to [[delete fucking everything]]! They took photos of their findings and destruction of the cartridge to post them as a trophy as well to [[troll]] the very few Shaq-Fu fan's in the world just for the [[lulz]]. Crushing, burning, freezing, runing over, thrown from high buildings, peeing on it, shoving it up a cat's ass, you name it, Shaq-Fu has endured many [[Mortal Kombat|fatalities]] at the hands of these people. Many [[noobs]] who thought it was an awesome idea did like wise to buy the cartridge from ebay, record the destroying of them on cheap out dated video cameras, and post it on [[youtube]]. This act did not infact made them cool, but even more retarded than usual. The site is still up but the liberation of the world of Shaq-Fu has been severely been cut since GameStop doesn't sell used Sega Genesis or SNES games anymore. See for yourself.

==Shaq Fu Search and Rescue==
[[Image:7.thumb.jpg|thumb|A perfectly innocent Shaq-Fu which was saved from the clutched of the other faction and adopted in a warm loving home.]]
[[Image:Saveshaqfu.jpg|thumb|Yes, they're fucking serious.]]
Over the years, Shaq-Fu must have accumulated a [[at least 100|cult group of fans]]. This must be true since not long after Shaqfu.com went up, a rival site known as saveshaqfu.com rose out of the cries of innocent Shaq-Fu's worldwide. If Shaqfu.com was the [[Nazi]] for Shaq-Fu, then saveshaqfu.com was the Jew for the game. Yep, that's right. This site is dedicated to giving a warm loving home to every copy Shaq-Fu. This quickly became a session of [[trolls trolling trolls]] between the two factions as saveshaqfu also reaped in countless copies of the game (about 79). These fags are extremely dedicated to save every copy. With the time they spent on saving this game, they can actually do something useful. This website would have been labeled as a [[lulzkiller]], but the fact that they manage to make the other site rage is [[lulzworthy]]. All in all, choose your side!
