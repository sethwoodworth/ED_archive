{{rainbowsmall|PUNCTURED BICYCLES}}
[[16 year old girls]] have [[Linkin Park]], <s>and [[emo]] and [[scene]] kids have Morrissey.</s> Emo kids have [[shit|music]] inspired by Morrissey. His only [[Fags|fans]] are [[Twilight|fat middle-aged women]] and [[faggot]] [[spics]]

Morrissey - occasionally accused of being the lunatic responsible for [[emo]], thanks to his amazingly insightful and witty lyrics (''Come Armageddon! Come! Everyday is like Sunday, everyday is silent and gray!'') - the modus operandi of every [[emo]] [[hipster]], [[indie|indiefuck]] and [[fat]] [[goth]] girl. Amazingly, he's escaped retribution for his numerous musical crimes against humanity - like an unstoppable juggernaut, decimating the music landscape of the day with his boring, angsty and self-indulgent ranting  (See: [[Lowtax]]). The only thing stopping him has been the A+R men dropping him from their labels every 3 years, once they realize that he's immeasurably shit, and will never change.

He is best known for his "poetic" and boring lyrics about what a sad, old misanthrope he is and the fact that The Cure frontman, Robert Smith, hates his guts. Which is important, because [[Complaints Forum|complaintopia]] [[bullshit|consider him The holy trinity or Raptor Jesus]] Nowadays, Morrissey is a wrinkly old [[fag]] selling his soul to millions of [[Hot Topic]] and [[scene]] kids with no [[self-esteem]]. Fortunately for Internets, his legion of fans, while tearing the sad git's lyrics to pieces (while searching in vain for some shred of meaningful prose), are responsible for many internet [[lulz]]. If you put the Cure or even that [[David Bowie]] album where there's a live track with  the Cure, before or after the Smiths/Morrissey album on a playlist, Robert Smith and him start fighting. It's pretty neato.

This is a small mercy.

Morrissey is a former militant [[vegetarian]] and a former militant [[lies|asexual]], proving once again that he can talk a lot of shit, but when it comes down to it he just can't keep from stuffin' meat in his mouth, be it burgers or [[cock]].  (Note: Moz is still a vegetarian and still chaste, despite the myriad [[fat]] [[goth]] Tori Amos fans who want to fuck his brains out and cook an all meat-grill for him in the morning). He won't go to Canada because he talked a lot of shit about it and is afraid of being sacrificed to the pagan gods of milk bags and curling.

Morrissey is famous for his witty and acerbic put-downs of his detractors, so be careful not to get on his bad side. He famously described the writer of The Smiths' biography (Morrisey and Marr: The Severed Alliance), Johnny Rogan, as 'Johnny Rodent', if you can believe that. He also playfully retitled the book 'The Sausage Appliance'. Linguistic genius such as this is a gift to be treasured.

According to him, there is panic on the streets of London, but as it turns out it was drunk football hooligans and there was no panic, but there was lots of Jager, a DJ was hung, and zombies were killed.

== Morrissey as Lulz ==
Being cruel, sarcastic, and generally unpopular, many Morrissey fans have taken to embracing his work and personality in an ironic sense. This often involves the photoshopping of Morrissey images, [http://community.livejournal.com/manc_slash bad fanfic], and fake suicide attempts expressed with his more morose lyrics.

It must be noted that the vast majority of ‘Morrissey iz teh lolzers’ are genuine fans who spend vast quantities of their money on The Smiths vinyl rather than social activities, in which they are not included. This is usually because they bore others with constant and vivid recreations of the day they found a ‘This Charming Man’ single for $3 in a charity store. 

The intent of parody is often separation from the generic emo kids who consider one depressing song good reason to shop at Hot Topic. 

In a completely separate set of lulz, spoken-word poet Eirik Ott also named The Smiths "How Soon is Now?" the anthem for wussy boys in his poem [http://orion.csuchico.edu/Pages/vol42issue13/opinion/o.4.wussyboymanifesto.html The Wussy Boy Manifesto].

== Morrissey On Twitter ==

An [[lie|imposter]] Morrissey has been [[troll|trolling]] Morrissey [[fanboy|fanboys]] on [[Twitter]], who are too dumb to realize that Morrissey didn't really eat a kebab to piss off [[PETA]]. Trolling often includes correcting lyrics, asking fans to knit jumpers with his face on, and offering to come to people's houses and sing to them. If you wish to see Trollissey, visit [http://www.twitter.com/s_p_morrissey @s_p_morrissey] before his fanboys or lawyers get wise and shut it down.

== Morrissey Causes An Heroes==
It is widely suggested that Morrissey and Kelly Sheetz are the leading cause of [[Jodie_Gater_and_Stephanie_Gestier|suicide]]. It has also been suggested that [[Mitchell Henderson|suicide]] is the leading cause of Morrissey and Kelly Sheetz.  This is of course result of Asexuality.

==Morrissey Hits The Deck==
[[Image:Yomorrissey.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Imma Let You Finish|Kanye West was on the scene, thank Christ]]]]
On October 24th, 2009, Morrissey was performing in [[Shithole|Swindon]] when - [[faggot|after one song]] - he collapsed and was rushed to hospital. He's pulled this shit countless times in the past, so I wouldn't start putting down floral tributes outside [[Gay bar|Salford Lads' Club]] just yet, you [[Nerds|dashing young studs]]. Bookmakers are offering 10/1 odds that this is [[Michael Jackson|the real deal]] this time, others are simply saying he started something he couldn't finish.

==Amazing Lyrics by Morrissey==

{{quote|Your boyfriend, he
Went down on one knee
Well, could it be
He's only got one knee?| Morrissey - Showing Oscar Wilde-like wit}}

{{quote|And we just can't wait to make more mistakes
And to fluff our breaks, and to stuff our faces with [[cock|cake]]| Morrissey - being completely not gay!}}

{{quote| Legalized theft
Leaves me bereft
I get it straight in the neck
(Somehow expecting no less)
A court of justice
With no use for Truth
Lawyer ...liar
Lawyer ...liar | Morrissey - being butthurt after getting owned by former bandmates in court.}}

{{quote|Until he drew
A swallow on my neck
And more, I will not say
He drew
A swallow, deep and blue
And soon, everyone knew| Morrissey - Once again showing us how not gay he is.}}

{{quote|There's a naked man standing, laughing in your dreams
You know who it is
But you don't like what it means| Morrissey - Totally not gay!}}

{{quote|We're gonna be with you
We're gonna join you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama

And we'll be safe and sheltered in our graves
We'll come before you
and we will touch you
We'll go for one final hug, mama| Morrissey - On fucking his mother.}}
