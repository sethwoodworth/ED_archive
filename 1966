'''DJ Tiesto''' (Born December 25, 0B.C also known as God, Jesus, The Holy One) is <s>a talentless hack</s> [[God|the worlds greatest DJ]] who was the [[lie|first person in the whole universe to create Electronic Music]] and holds the world record for having [[over 9000]] punters [[die|OD]] at a [[Love Parade|concert]].

When not spending his time doing [[Cocaine|Coke]] off the tits of [[lolicon|super models]] or [[Tegan and Sara|twin Lesbian Canadian Singer Songwriters]], you can find him paying other real musicians to make music for him.

==History==
[[Image:Tiestopose.jpg|thumb|250px|Tiesto aka Jesus, doing the "Jesus pose" Before he is crucified by Romans]]
Sometime ago in [[Amsterdam]], While playing with a Fisher Price synth, Tiesto came to the realization that not one person in the world considered using this amazing piece of technology for the application of [[shit|writing actual music]], thus Tiesto though known at the time as [[Jesus]], decided to take a shit on the keys of the synth and recorded the sound that was released as his first [[lol|totally original track]], known today as, Adagio for Strings.

The Romans at the time though only liked Indie Rock though and thus while DJ Tiesto was playing a 5 hour DJ set on Mount Calvary, they snuck up behind him and nailed his hands to a piece of wood (Romans just did shit like that) while Tiesto did what is known today as "The Jesus Pose".

During Mid-1997 Tiesto reincarnated behind the DJ decks at Privilege in [[Ibiza]] and played a set that [[lie|blew so many minds]], it instantly rocketed him to the top of the monthly UK dance music bible DJMAG's Worlds Best DJ poll.

During sometime in 2007 he tried his hands at alchemy but it didn't work out for him as his only talent was taking a shit on a microphone.
His attempts were recorded and released as the album "Elements of Life" which sold 7 bajillion copies.

==Supposed Death==

{{Quote|'Tiesto RIP - 0BC to Infinity'}}

A certain [http://dj.tiesto.swellserver.com/news/top_stories/auto80.php fake news report] about Tiesto's demise in a drunken car crash got into the hands of the [[truth|greatest reporting team in Australia]] who decided to announce the "breaking news" live on air to the <s>horror</s> joy of every trance fan in the country. Within minutes the internet was abuzz with news of the DJs death because [[retards|people]] seem to have the memory of a goldfish and don't realize that this rumour surfaces EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

[[Fox News|World wide news agencies who don't actually fact-check any of their stories]], quickly interrupted their broadcasts with [[good|hard-hitting]] news that DJ Tiesto had indeed died in a car crash despite no actual proof of this what so ever.

The next day DJ Tiesto posted on his Twitter and Facebook account that he indeed was still alive and was [[lie|"moved"]] but the touching sentiments of his [[drug addicts|fans]] who actually believed the rumour, despite appearing every month. This was of course too late as Black Hole recordings already moved to capitalize on Tiesto's death and re-released his album "In My Memory" to a worldwide audience that [[Micheal Jackson|"Actually liked Tiesto"]] because of his fake untimely death.

==Future==

It is not known what the future holds for fans of DJ Tiesto, most believe that in 2011 we will get his long awaited "Allure Album" Which will most likely feature such sort after recordings of the time DJ Tiesto got high on meth, stumbled into a preschool and started sodomizing children.

We can expect Tiesto to keep playing behind the wheels of steel until the end of time as lets face it, getting paid like a million dollars to crossfade between two fucking records? Who wouldn't do that shit?
