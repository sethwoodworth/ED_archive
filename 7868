Stuff
[[Image:Sheryl Crow Stuff.jpg|thumb|Publication dedicated to stuff; this issue featuring a [[Canada|Canadian]].]]
Term used by the lazy instead of a lot of typing. Also a verb used for what [[Ronnie Coleman]] does to [[Tila Tequila]].

Example:
"I did ''stuff'' today" as the entirety of an LJ post, "I stuffed your sister" as a flame, or "I bought ''stuff''," rather than actually think and write about what you bought.

"Shit" can be freely interchanged with "stuff" depending on the mood of the author and tone of the piece.  "I bought ''shit''" is a valid example, and does not necessarily mean you went to the [[poop drama|UPS Store]].  This term is usually rejected by 13-year-old [[AOL|AOLers]] when there is the possibility of parents catching them during a [[POS]] moment. Even "I shitted your sister" works, although in "proper" [[english]] say we say "I shat your sister."
