Chuck Dowling
[[Image:Alan_greenspan.jpg|thumb|Chuck Dowling is a fucking asshole]] 
Known internet asshole Chuck Dowling likes to bait people on [[LiveJournal]] into mentioning his name. Then he complains to [[LJ Abuse]] that his personal information has been exposed in an attempt to get that LiveJournal suspended. Chuck Dowling doesn't even have an account on LiveJournal and doesn't read any users of the site. Chuck Dowling found himself mentioned on LiveJournal by [[vanity search]]ing his name on Google. The original poster of his name to LiveJournal quoted a post Chuck Dowling made to a photography website (where he had used his real name to identify himself). LJ Abuse is so intent on protecting the name of Chuck Dowling that they have suspended people for quoting him using names that rhyme with his, like Duck Howling, or Fuck Chowling.

Because Chuck Dowling uses vanity searches on Google, many people have purchased Google AdWords of his name. These link to various websites that expose Chuck Dowling for being a free-speech hating asshole who can't take a good photograph to save his ass. Chuck Dowling's anti-[[free speech]] views are rather ironic in someone who thinks of himself as a journalist. 

Chuck Dowling is an absolute failure as a photographer.

There are other Chuck Dowling references on the Internet, including an author and a film critic. The author who shares the name may indeed by an asshole but he is not the internet asshole that this article is about. This makes it all the more ridiculous for LJ Abuse to claim that the name Chuck Dowling refers to anyone in particular.
