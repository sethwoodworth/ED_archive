{{achtung|THIS GAME HAS LOTS OF PORN}}
[[Image:Mabinogi Nao.jpg|thumbnail|right|DO IT NAO. ([[I See What You Did There|See what I did thar?]])]]
''[[Mabinogi]]'' is a [[shit|shitty]] [[Korean]] [[MMORPG]] by the same guys who did ''[[Maple Story|MapleStory]]''.  ''Mabinogi'' is popular with 12 to 16 year olds who have no money and cannot play ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.  It is also popular with the [[weeaboo]] community largely due to its strong anime themes. (Note that if this sounds at all familiar, [[Ragnarok Online|it should]].)

==Gameplay==
The game plays a lot like ''Ragnarok Online'', which plays a lot like ''Diablo'', which plays a lot like a number of old SSI computer games.  Move the mouse, click the enemy, kick its ass, and repeat until you die of old age or [[suicide|kill yourself]].

You can go fishing to raise your dexterity, but it takes about 9,000 years before you can go up a rank in it. The game revolves around [[Boring|training your skills]], then spending AP to raise them. The more you do it, the harder and harder (Read: More money you spend) it gets to actually raise it, and it will cost [[moar]] AP.

With a name like [[Otaku|Fantasy Life]] going for it, you can bet that people do treat it like it is their only life. You can make an ugly female character and buy a [[Fetish|maid outfit]] and learn how to cook and pretend you are an actual anime woman! You can buy an explorers outfit and grind exploration levels (Which reset every time you rebirth, meaning you have to keep doing [[boring]] quests over and over again)

It's full of incredible amounts of busy-work that you just don't want to do. If you're not leveling, you're probably [[Boring|grinding]] for materials that go for absurd amounts on the in-game market. NPCs don't give you squat if you sell anything to them, so don't bother. But the [[Asshole|assholes]] [[Fags|will turn around and overprice certain items regardless]]. If not that, you're probably trying to gain [[E-peen|proficiency]] on your weapon. You don't just go to a blacksmith and tell someone to upgrade your weapon, it doesn't work like that. You have to [[Genocide|beat up enemies with it]] and get points on the weapon, THEN you can upgrade it. It costs tons of gold and tons of points just to get one upgrade too, and if you don't do it you will insta-[[fail]].

Not only that, you have to worry about the repairing of these said weapons. If you want to try and keep your weapons in tip top shape, you have to shell out so much [[Jewgold|cash]] you'll probably end up [[Pussy|buying some gold]] from [[China|Chinese Gold Farmers]] to make ends meet. All blacksmiths except one have a repair rate of 96% or lower. The one with 98% charges [[Bullshit|unbelievable rates for just one point of repair]], the kind of rates that would make even [[Bill Gates]] think twice.

The monotony doesn't end there. Not only does it take a few years of dedicated game play and credit card swiping to get anywhere in this game, you also have to worry about a broken e-Conomy that overprices ugly clothes that were released on old events because the [[newfags]] think it's "retro". There are even dyes that have [[Seizure|flashing]] properties, when applied to clothes they flash between colors and give [[Epilepsy|epileptics]] one hell of a seizure and hurt the eyes of those healthy. People literally [[whore]] out for these in order to act [[Fail|cool]] among the other [[Mexico|trash]] that plays this game. It's all about getting the prettiest clothes made for [[you]]

[[tl;dr]], this game is boring.

===[[Fap|F2P]] vs. [[Internet money|P2P]]===
The game can be played from start to finish over the course of [[never|forever]], but only if you're willing to pay for it.  While it's totally free to play, all the good stuff (such as good-looking hair, entire chains of quests, or items that let you [[spam]] the entire server with your [[stupidity|wisdom]]) cost Nexon Cash, which in turn costs [[money|real money]].  Needless to say, the game is primarily dominated by spoiled rich kids with mommy's credit card in their pockets.

==Races==
[[File:Mabinogi1.jpg|thumb|right|Generic!]]
At present time, there are only three races to choose from, 
One thing that sets the game apart from the endless number of other games just like it is the overbearing amount of customization you can give your character.
* '''[[Human]]''' - [[You]], [[me]], [[your mom]].  The game favors these adorable rascals over the other two for [[racism|various reasons]].  As such, humans get the best of everything and can finish the entire game.  Can equip two swords at once, but can't equip two of anything else for some reason. They run the slowest in the game though. Humans being the first race to be released in Grindinogi have some of the uberl33test and players with the huegest of epeens. Good luck trying to overpower them with your puny penis. 
* '''[[Queer|Elf]]''' - Humans with pointy ears.  Really good at [[Pussy|hiding]] and shooting arrows.  Generally frail and can't lift over 20 lbs. They can also fire two arrows and charge the fastest with Ranged Combat, making them perfect for trolling opposing players. Can also run very fast. All the humans and giants hope to god the elves wont get their sharp frail little fingers on a skill called Arrow Revolver which the Humans can use and is basically the only skill that allows them to troll better than the Elves. But everyone knows its going to happen eventually. 
* '''[[Furry|Giant]]''' - Huge people pumped up on sterroids.  Can [[rage]], equip two of anything humans can equip except swords, and has the largest arsenal of the three races including but not limited to [[banhammer|giant fucking sledgehammers]] and [[chat log|dead trees]].  Can't play dead or even throw rocks despite their immense strength. Can run faster than humans, but slower than Elves. They have a tendancy to rage when trolled too hard and will complain about everything imaginable, usually how their internet connection sucks, but its really just them that suck. Under 16 players tend to play as giants because they're cooler and taller than themselves and helps feed their epeen, the smarter folks go elf or human

==[[FYIAD|Transformations]]==
[[File:MabinogiFalconSage.jpg|thumb|right|Falcon Sage]]
[[File:MabinogiSavageBeast.jpg|thumb|right| ([[Bestiality|Beast Lord]])]]
If you pay money to get all of the kewl bonuses from the in-game cash shop, you will be allowed to use a transformation for your character based on their race when you finish the main story or the quest related to it. Humans have the chance to become [[White Knight|Paladins]] or [[Emo|Dark Knights]], while [[Fag|Elves]] can become Falcon [[Sage|Sages]], and Giants can become Abominable Snow Men. Though your character looks like nothing more than a weak, feeble insect, when you transform they suddenly hit puberty and gain big stats for one in-game hour, which is only about five minutes [[IRL]]. You can only transform once every in-game day, and the duration of your transformation also increases by a few seconds each time you [[Unbirthing|Rebirth]] (Which costs [[Jewgold|money]], did I mention that?)

'''[[Retard|Paladin]]''': The epitome of faggotry in this game, only losers play as paladins because they claim it offers just '''TWO''' bonus points of Protection stat, making them better than everyone else. These internet white knights often get into [[Some Argue|arguments]] with players who are Dark Knights, resulting in massive [[Lulz|lulz]]-fests where ever they happen, each claiming they are better than the other when the simple fact in this game is that [[Micropenis|Arrow]] > [[Cock|Sword]]. Also Paladins have no inherent skill like the other transformations do, making them the most [[Fail|fail]].

'''[[Basement Dweller|Dark Knight]]''': The weakest transformation available to Human players. Upon Transformation for the first time you look like a teenage [[Lord of the Rings|Sauron]] and you have the coolest attack animations with certain weapons. Unfortunately when your duration is up and it comes time to devolve back into your weak human state, you don't do it automatically. Instead, you start losing health until you die unless you manually return form. Only [[Emo|emos]] play as this because they think it makes them [[leet|leet]] and is the only emotional crutch they have in this crappy game. They also have an ability that lets them [[Buttsex|take control]] of other monsters with their [[Psychic|mind]], allowing them to bring them into town and set them loose upon the [[Owned|noobs]]. The final transformation looks [[Gay|gay]] too.

'''[[Homo|Falcon Elf]]''': Arguably the coolest looking transformation if you are playing a [[Woman|female]] and have the final transformation, but they only say that because it has [[Idiot|AWESUM WINGZ N SHIT]]. Has the ability to cast [[Dungeons and Dragons|Magic Missile]] and [[Nuke|nuke]] their enemies with [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|fireballs]], thunder storms, and blizzards. Charges ranged attack EVEN FASTER allowing for maximum ownage.[[Fail|But it can't even fly even if it does have wings]].

'''[[Furry|Savage Beast]]''': The biggest thing in the game aside from the dragons. Has the most strength, but still cannot throw giant boulders at their enemies despite being able to knock down '''[[Stupid|10 FT TREES AND USE THEM AS WEAPONS]]''' Has the ability to charge up a wide swing attack and decimate enemies that are close to them, but it sucks and nobody cares about it. Perfect race for furries.

==Classes==
The game itself is very [[goatse|open-ended]] in that there's no pre-set classes.  A player is free to choose whatever they want to be and use any equipment their race can equip.  However, there are some amount of "builds" floating around out there for people who think they're [[doing it wrong]].

* '''Master of Combat''' - Put all your Ability Points into "Combat Mastery" and become ub3rl33t!  Nah, just kidding.  Melee sucks balls in this game!  Your best bet is to equip two of anything or a two-handed weapon and just knock the shit out anything that comes your way.  "Windmill" and "Final Hit" probably wouldn't hurt, either.
* '''Arrow Revolver''' - Great for [[trolling]] [[leet]] PvPers.  Pour all your Ability Points into "Arrow Revolver" and watch your opponents [[ragequit]] as you destroy them with endless arrow spam.
* '''Ice Wizard''' - The magic version of Gatling Shot build.  Also great for [[trolling]].  Pour all your Ability Points into "Icebolt" and watch your opponents ragequit as you spam it.
* '''Fire Wizard''' - Most powerful build in the game.  Pour all your Ability Points into "Fireball" and do a million points of damage to everyone around you in one hit.
* '''Master Alchemist''' - Summon a golem and spam "Flame Burst" and "HP Drain" while it distracts your opponent.  Also, throw up some spiked barriers so no one can touch you.
* '''Bard''' - Master "Music Playing", "Composition", and "Musical Knowledge" and gain the ability to buff and heal your allies by playing [[Caramelldansen]] over and over again!  [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpfHFFWxvcs No, seriously].

==The Game Itself==
[[File:NaoSex1.jpg|thumb|right|Congratulations! You know how to use your dick now, if you can find it.]]
[[File:NaoSex2.jpg|thumb|right|She has the nicest body.]]
[[File:NaoSex3.jpg|thumb|right|She's the best at what she does!]]
[[File:NaoSex4.jpg|thumb|right|The best Christmas gift ever.]]
When you first install this trainwreck, you're greeted with only one character card. It's basic, so you can't make any premium adjustments. You have to '''BUY THOSE CARDS''' if you want to be pretty, by the way. After entering the screen, you can start at [[Toddlercon|Age 10]] to [[Jailbait|Age 17]] and be either a [[Bitch|female]] or a [[Autism|male human]]. [[Pedophile|Smart people]] will start at Age 10 because you gain 5 AP(Ability Points) every time your character's birthday comes around. Your character's birthday is one week after the first time you make them. After choosing from your very limited amount of basic colors and styles, and having a retarded looking character that everyone else will make fun of, you can start the game! Note to some, if you [[What|actually want to play this game]], you have to buy multiple cards if you want multiple characters. You also have to buy pet cards if you want to have pets.

You will first be in the soul stream, which plays both a big factor in this game's story, and also does not. One of the most [[Awesome|amazing]] things in gaming history will be there to greet you after a few seconds. A girl with very big [[boobs]], long hair, deep blue eyes, and a black one-piece [[China|Chinese dress]]. It should be noted [[Slut|she isn't wearing any underwear either]]. Her name is [[Nao]]. [[Srsly]]. When she floats down and lands, her breats [[Hot|jiggle]] as [[Cum|icing]] on the [[Delicious Cake|cake]].

She gives you a book that tells you how to play the game, and she gives you some bread, showing that she can indeed cook and has a [[In the kitchen|kitchen]], but this is the only time that she ever makes you a sandwich. If you're a [[Horny|nice person]], you can actually buy her clothes(From the Cash shop mind you) and find them in [[Bondage|dungeons]], and the next time you rebirth you can give them to her and she'll wear them. The only problem is, you'll only see these skimpy outfits on her if you have her come to revive you if you die somewhere, which costs IRL money to have that kind of [[Sex|service]]. [[Bitch|She won't wear these anywhere else.]] You can also never talk to her when you want, and if a quest actually requires you to see her (And some do), you have to wait until you can rebirth.

Before one of the biggest patches, to rebirth you had to wait '''THREE WEEKS'''(Three character birthdays), which is also roughly a month, and purchase another character card. After you met these requirements, you could do it. You cannot be successful in this game unless you rebirth, it is impossible. You can only ever go so far when it comes to leveling, and eventually, your characters [[Oldfag|aging]] will stop giving you AP, and you can never train your skills until you do this. After this big patch, if you bought a premium card [[Scam|(Which costs about $10 USD)]] you can rebirth in just one week. You can rebirth for free if you wait three weeks, but you can't change anything about your character. This game is perfectly designed to be a gigantic money sink if you want to stay competitive against ever increasing difficulty. The best you can do without [[Insane|clawing your fucking eyes out]] is to reach level 50 every rebirth, after that it's plain stupid to try and level anymore.

[[LOL|GUESS WHAT LOL YOU CAN'T EVEN BEAT G1'S MAIN STORY UNLESS YOU ARE LIKE LEVEL 400 AND HAVE SOME HIGHLY RANKED SKILLS BEHIND YOU]]. That, or you can [[Fellatio|suck some dick]] and join some [[Nerds|guilds]] to get the lazy fags who've been [[No life|playing a lot longer than you]] to help you beat it so you can transform and be cool too.

It costs about [[WTF|$25 USD]] to buy all three services this game has available. Extra storage, getting a [[Dildo|free item]] from [[Prostitute|Nao]] every [[Dying alone|birthday]] your character celebrates, and the ability to play the main story and use the transformations. Oh by the way, this service only lasts '''1 month'''.

You don't have to just spend your money on this, however!! Nexon NA, being the expert Korean & Mexican scammers they are have implemented another feature to the in-game cash shop. You can buy in game items too! Though you can tell this is complete [[bullshit]] because the other versions don't have [[E-peen|2x EXP potions]] in their shops, and you can't get every single item in the game from their cash shops either!

So now that you know this game is simply intended to rip as much money from the American populace as possible, you should also know that even after two whole years of being in service, this game still lacks proper maintenance. Oh sure, Nexon can slap up about [[Seriously|16 hours of failed maintenance]] once in a while, but it doesn't do jack shit. Glitches and bugs still haunt this game from it's open beta. Not only that, with each introduction of new content, they manage to fuck everything else up all the time. Bad translations, horrible spelling and grammar, and broken quest chains. If you try to tell the fans of this game any of this, they'll just cover their ears and make noises to blot out the [[truth]]. Oh, and unlike other versions, every time you [[Sex|initiate a conversation]] with an NPC, [[Stupidity|the game locks up for two seconds before you actually get the chat window with them]].

You have to admit though, devCat had a good trick up their sleeve with this [[Tits|busty girl]] Nao. They knew all of the potential fans for this game were [[Fail|lonely]], [[virgin]], unrepentant [[Weeaboo|weeaboos]] who think [[Japan]] is the greatest thing ever. [[Idiots|Too bad they usually forget this game came from KOREA]]. There isn't porn of just her, but people often draw their [[Bestiality|characters having sex with the in game monsters]], or the [[Lonely|Ego Weapon spirits]].

===Meet the Community===
Every Server has a few faggots that are probably considered [[Tom Cruise|famous]] amongst the everyday mabinogi community. Meaning faggots that just lurk and stand outside the bank for long hours or do nothing else other than feel pro and piss off all the other players, much to the lulz of many who get it.

'''Mari Server, ([[Americunt]] server, also the best server)'''
* '''Antagonist''': The most fail guild ever, run by Craddle. He's one of the most butthurt losers in all of Mari server. A 28 year old, divorced loser with no job who spends his time playing Mabinogi the most fail way possible. He secretly conspires against everyone who doesn't do him favors and calls them out saying they are scammers, hackers, dupers, cheaters, mod abusers, etc. The real leader, Envoy, was too nice to do anything about Craddle walking all over his guild. Craddle was some reject with a fail guild that flopped 2 years ago called TGDG, which stood for The Gay Dick Grabbers (rumors stated it meant The Golem Destroyer Guild, but what kind of faggot would add "guild" in their guild name?)

Craddle has been known to abuse naive players and take advantage of their lack of knowledge and scam people out of their possessions. He also has publicly stated he does not associate with dupers/mod abusers, yet has also been seen publicly kissing ass of some major abusers on Mari server. He is a flaming hypocrite, flaming gay, and his picture can be found here http://i55.tinypic.com/15f3ibp.gif.

All of the guilds on Mari are somewhat "ok" but regardless, any guild Craddle is found in, he will attempt to weasle his way to an authority position, then it will crash and burn like every other guild in history. He is currently the officer of Adversary, after much dick sucking and taking it in the ass. Avoid this plater at all costs.

'''Ruairi Server (h4ck3r [[leet|l337]] server)'''
*'''Trash''': Ruairi is full of inside jokes from the more "popular" guilds , yet every [[newfag|newfag]] thinks they are entitled to be in the conversation of said jokes. (EX: meat [starting at [http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/forums/thread/5875062.aspx this] then because of that resulting in [http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/forums/thread/5886106.aspx this]], zomfdolphin, [http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/search/SearchResults.aspx?u=94158&PageIndex=1 nari], [http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/forums/thread/4429114.aspx paravex], [[niggers|kool kidz klub]], anything Inuri has ever posted. [[Evar|Ever]].) Way too obsessed with PvP, because they like to feel like [[Internet Tough Guy|LOL STRONG PROS]] when they camp you on their [[serious buisness|level 10 elf]]. Everything is dominated by mods, and not the [[banhammer|banhammer]] kind. Every little noob will join Martyr for their <s>mods</s> [[Lie|experienced players]]. Though some noobs actually learn ''how'' to mod, like [[weeaboo|xbankaiguyx]] who gets [[spam|spammed]] 20 times a second every time a new patch comes out.
Other than said obvious trash, Ruairi is generally a fun place to be around if you're [[Clique|"in"]], with jokes such as [[Old meme|OH GREAT PARAVEX DARK LORD]]. By the way, Inuri is Ruairi's [[original content|OC]] [[Allah|god]];and evolved the Paravex joke a LOT, like seen [http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/forums/post/4985997.aspx here]. Though,[http://forum.nexon.net/Mabinogi/forums/thread/4902240.aspx previous acts] by [[roleplay|Dark Lord Paravex]] did NOT help [[Unrealistic Expectations|keep it a private joke]].  

'''tl;dr''':Everyone in the game is absolutely retarded and gay, if you ask a [[Autistic|rich 12 year old]] (that stole his parent's credit card number to buy himself gold so he can feel speshuls) if you can try his expensive armor on. He will likely accept so you can just run off with his [[epeen]] and watch him [[fail|fruitlessly]] attempt to get his stuff back via spamming nexon. All the while knowing they wont do [[shit]] for him. If someone says they have a girlfriend in this game they are likely lieing, everyone is a virgin just like you, reading this right now. [[Trap|All the girls are actually guys]], if they prove their femeninity by showing a picture, its likely ripped off from facebook. 
All in all most people treat mabinogi like an overglorified chat program, kind of like [[Gaia Online|Weaboo Online]] My guild is better than your guild arguments cause extreme level shitstorms oh wait all mmorpgs are shitstorms anyways.
