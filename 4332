Jim Davidson is an [[English]] [[Nazi|working man's club]] comedian, who endeavours to carry on the fine British comedy tradition of [[racism|racist]] and [[cumdumpster|sexist]]  jokes.

His stand-up routine is a [[old|cutting-edge]] [[Combofag|combination]] of jokes about black person, cripples, [[teh]] [[gheys]], and anyone who isn't [[white]], [[English]], and from [[London]]. This usually generates [[Over 9000|vast amounts]] of [[drama]]. [[Some Argue|Some have argued]] that he does it for the [[lulz]], except it [[anti-lulz|isn't funny]].

In September 2007, Jim Davidson was thrown out of a reality TV show for calling a [[fag]] a [[fag]]. Truly the [[Jews|ZOG machine]] has [[Winrar|won]].

== Drama ==

[[Image:Dowling gay.jpg|thumb|The shirtlifter in question.]]

In September of 2007, Jim was kicked off the [[lie|celebrity]] reality TV show 'Hell's [[In the kitchen|Kitchen]]' for insulting another [[fail]] celebrity, Big Brother contestant Brian Dowling, by calling him a 'shirtlifter', which is UK slang for a [[fag|gay]]. Although this was an entirely accurate assessment of his [[Furry|deviant lifestyle]], the media collectively [[shit bricks]] and demanded his head. Even the notoriously [[Conservatism|right wing]] newpaper [[tabloid|The Daily <s>Mail</s> Fail]] jumped on the 'Fuck Jim' bandwagon.

No stranger to [[drama|controversy]], 4 years earlier he cancelled gigs because [[asspie|disabled]] audience members at one of his performances refused to be moved from the front row. Given the [[Nazi]]'s policy towards the [[Retard|handicapped]], it wasn't the best move on their part. But then they are mentals.
