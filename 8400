Threats of violence
[[Image:An hero romanian wikipedian.jpg|thumb|A [[Romanian]] Wikipedian threatens to become [[an hero]] for the sake of [[butthurt|unrequited love]], and gets [[Alison]] and [[Ryulong]]'s [[panties]] in a twist.]]
'''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Threats of violence|Wikipedia:Threats of violence]]''' and its bastard twin '''[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Responding to threats of harm|Wikipedia:Responding to threats of harm]]''' are the [[Wikipedia]] <s>[[Policy|policies]]</s> essays (lol demoted) dictating that violent threats on TOW should be immediately reported to the cops. Paranoid faggots who only feel safe in a police state tried to make them into policy but they were defeated by those who realized that something straight out of [[Bush]]'s post-9/11 America and the UK that [[Tony Blair]] dreamed of was obviously a terrible idea. The Internet may be [[serious business]] but it's ''not'' that serious. They are normally brought out for when an [[attention whore]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatPeter&diff=120825859&oldid=120797919 posts] a [[suicide]] notice on their userpage. The cops are always called, the editor is always found alive, and another name is kept off of [[Deceased Wikipedians]]. It is also used when a [[chan]]ner [[newfag]] who thinks he's the next [[Jake Brahm]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Northwest_Airlines&curid=146068&diff=210453742&oldid=210185999 vandalizes an airlines article with terroristic threats]. No doubt the [[thirteen-year-old boy]] thought he was hilarious until he realized that [[Seven Proxies]] doesn't stop the [[partyvan]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=210721502#FBI_called] The irony here is that while Wikipedia has policies like [[BLP]] expressively to avoid ruining someones life with [[libel]], they are cursing innocent kids with forever having to check the "Have you ever been arrested?" box on a job application, that is if they aren't just extraordinary renditioned to Guantanmo Bay.

This drama normally goes unnoticed even by the vultures at the [[Wikipedia Review]], quickly fading away as the thread on the [[Administrators' noticeboard]] is archived into obscurity.
In April however, somebody noticed that the normal [[vandalism]] on the Wikipedia page of [[Wikipedia:Glen A. Wilson High School|Glen A. Wilson High School]] seemed a little off on the one year anniversery of [[VTECH]]:

{{squote|This is a warning. Do not remove this from this page. On Friday, April 18, 2008, there will be a shooting at this school. Current list of victims to be shot on this day: [a bunch of [[azn]]s], a good majority of the badminton team, and almost every single fob. Take this text down and it will guarantee their death so I suggest you don't.|Is he kidding?}}

However, [[ClueBot]], being a soulless automaton that does not care about the [[children]], reverted. (Rest easy [[Dramacrats]], [[MysteryBot]] would never do something so cruel.) Regardless, [[Ryulong]] would've just removed it anyways for he finds possibly credible death threats to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:PatPeter&diff=next&oldid=120907400 "be in extremely poor taste"]. No doubt the attacker was loading clips as he typed out his next message:

{{squote|You removed my last edit. I gave you a fair warning. Now the people listed in my previous edit will now be victims in the Glen A. Wilson Shooting to occur this Friday. Your lack of attention to the seriousness of my warning will now be the reason as to why you will receive all fault of this event. Be prepared to have 33 families mourn the loss of their children and place a lawsuit upon your shoulders.|Apparently not.}}

===Down the rabbit hole===
[[Image:Wilson school threat.jpg|thumb|Apparently not big enough of a one to fix their damn sign.]]
A shitstorm immediately erupted on the [[Administrators' noticeboard]], and it was discovered that this [[bullshit]] had been going on for a year. Starting in May 2007, the [[Anonymous pussy]] had been using the TOW entry on his High School as his private [[LiveJournal]]. He left entries about  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glen_A._Wilson_High_School&diff=132833527&oldid=132622389 an Azn chick falling in a cheer rally], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glen_A._Wilson_High_School&diff=134145384&oldid=134145113 how she treated him like shit] ([[PROTIP]]: He deserved it.), and how some [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glen_A._Wilson_High_School&diff=132842100&oldid=132833945 slut turned him down]. All in all, sadder than [[Alex Wuori]]. There was even a death threat from back then: ''"[[Creepy|And we all know that isn't true so why let her live? I would love to see her shot right between the eyes with blood gushing out from her mouth begging for mercy as she clings onto a single shred of life. Haha now there's a great fantasy.]]"'' However '''Threats of violence''' wasn't keeping our streets safe back in 2007, and he got away with it...that time.

===Wikipedia saves countless lives===
[[Image:Waco4.jpg|thumb|Wheew, tragedy averted.]]
As the Wikipedos were afraid of a repeat of the infamous [[Chris Benoit]] [[Chris_Benoit#TOW_Accomplice_to_Murder|incident where the crime was reported on TOW before the police knew about it]], a sysop finally decided that the [[lol wut|right thing to do in a crisis like this was to call the motherfuckin' LAPD]]. Minutes after [[Wikimedia Foundation]] staff called the police 13 detectives were assigned to the case, more than another black person dead in Compton ever got. The next morning the school was surrounded by dozens of heavily armed cops and students had to wait in a line two blocks long to be searched. The Sophomore fuck responsible for this mess was arrested the next day and made a full confession. He was [http://www.knbc.com/news/15985793/detail.html charged with seven felonies], approximately equal to the [[Seven Proxies|number of proxies]] he should've used if he expected to get way with this.

The suspect's excuse was that death threats on Wikipedia, a private website, [[lulz|were covered by the First Amendment]]. 
Instead of stopping a possible [[Eric Harris]], this drama ensnared a whiny bitch who complained [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glen_A._Wilson_High_School&diff=205283319&oldid=205252816 about how his supposed friends didn't invite him to a party], how the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glen_A._Wilson_High_School&diff=205251592&oldid=204791385 Badminton team didn't make districts], and hated Asians because they set the curve in AP Calculus. At least [[Trey Burba]] actually had guns, the only weapon this douche had was his [[nerd rage]].
