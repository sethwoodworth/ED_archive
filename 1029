'''Bleedman''' ('''Vinson Ngo''' [[irl]]) is an [[AZN]] [[pedo|pedophilic]] [[deviantART]] (and [http://www.snafu-comics.com Snafu Comics]) [[artist]] who, in a [[Goatse|shockingly]] expected display from a DA user, shows little talent for drawing, and has no imagination when it comes to storytelling. He uses it all on shitty fan comics instead of on something that could earn him money or, in effect, [[hookers and blow]]. He is a man who [[what|'''recently entered his 40's''']], but keeps a close eye on [[lolicon|shiny anime]]; His dA frontpage displays [[over 9000|a shitload of pageviews]] due to his fucking huge fan base made of [[fail|pure fail]], [[weeaboo|weeaboos]] [[trying too hard]] to [[slut|appeal to his attention]], and of course, the [[pedophilia|future priests]] that will [[rape|take care of]] your children. '''Snafu Comics''' has reached such popularity, that it's said in the legends that there is a red link in [[Wikipedia|ToW]] referring to that site, which N.A.S.A. calls '''Virtual Fandom Pedo Area'''; it is also mentioned in the U.S. Army manuals and has been a [[typical]] topic in [[pedophilia|Christian discussions]]. The fact remains, however, that Blo'oldman wouldn't have that huge fucking fan base if he used original characters rather than established, not to mention [[copyright]]ed, ones. His massive legions of fans are, as mentioned above, illiterate morons. They are [http://eylam.deviantart.com/art/Marv-s-freestyle-super-brawl-94783491 trying too hard] [http://justtj.deviantart.com/art/I-Got-You-94960952 to worship this pedo], who has passed [[deviantART]] rules by his tiny dick almost in every post and laughs at the [[retards|administrators of the site]] just because he has enough pageviews to be semi-[[banhammer]]proof.

'''[[Mudkipz|So I herd u liek]] Bleedmanz?''' NEWSFLASH: he doesn't liek [[you]]. Even if you crawl in your intestines, without eyes, [http://op-kk-y-3-4-21-900.deviantart.com/art/Bleedman-s-DeeDee-88908972 covered in your shit], [http://fc03.deviantart.com/fs32/f/2008/224/3/3/Bell_test_by_Solemonias_The_wise.gif shit], [http://darkjak.deviantart.com/art/Gift-Art-for-bleedman-11911242 shit], [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/824362/809767084 begging him to notice your] [[shit|talents]], he still wouldn't give any crap about you or anyone else who likes him.

==[[Powerpuff Girls]] Doujinshi==

[[Image:Bleedmanblossompanty.jpg|thumb|right|Pantyshots of elementary school lolis feature often in this comic. Of course, in Asia looking up little girl's skirts is cute and [[rape]] [http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/09/04/burglar-hitting-girls-is-wrong-so-i-raped-her/ is polite].]]

The ''Powerpuff Girls'' doujinshi is Bleedman's bread and butter, the thing that attracted a massive following of devianTART's lame cock sucker weeaboo population to him and elevated him to the status of ([http://spyed.deviantart.com/journal/6058338/ literally]) "The Most Popular Person on devianTART". The comic takes place in some town named Megaville, which happens to be the most original name ever. It crosses over every Cartoon Network show Bleedman happened to be watching at the time, and when he ran out of CN characters to rape (poor holy childhoods) he started throwing in Nickelodeon characters as well, or any other character his fantards begged to see rendered in all their pedophilic animu glory. Kind of like ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''.

[[Image:Spanking.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedobear]] is unimpressed with his delivery.]]

[[Image:ZimMaiduniform.jpg|thumb|left|[[unfunny|"Bleedman also likes to make things a bit of a laugh like Zim in his maid uniform! XD.]]]] 

This comic features a version of Samurai Jack who is no longer concerned with saving the future from a horrible Japanese demon as he is with making sure the children of Megaville Elementary are well educated in history and are physically fit. It features Dexter of ''Dexter's Lab'' fame with a tragic past in which his airheaded sister Dee Dee is tragically [http://bleedman.deviantart.com/art/ppg-chapter-4-p7-8-11877508 killed] by his rival science geek. Despite how absolutely [[stupid]] it is to introduce horrible murder into an innocent children's comedy, his fans eat this [[shit]] up. It also features far too much of [[otherkin|Invader Zim]] [[it's a trap!|in a French maid's outfit]]. What the FUCK?!.

Also, despite his usual, nearly mental shit retentive attention to canon information, he has decided to turn blindly away from the fact that almost every character he uses in the comic lives in a city of another name, thus showing that his works aren't really much better than anyone else's fan comic... and showing the fuckhead he is.

The end result of all of his redesigns of the characters he puts in his comic is that they look like someone shoved them through Todd McFarlane's brain and up Gary Glitter's ass. Unfortunately his influence has spawned [[at least 100]] other copycat animu Powerpuff Girls all over devianTART and the internets, not to mention the mountains of fanart for Bleedman (especially of his Mary Sue evil Powerpuff Girl), and we can probably blame Bleedman for the creation of an actual, terrible, obviously-aimed-at-lolicon-fucks Japanime version of the show: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKOVgAAzAYU ''Powerpuff Girls Z''].

This comic, however, ended quite abruptly on dA and has been placed on "hiatus" on Snafu Comics to make way for Bleedman's next, even worse, [[fandom]] [[Bullshit]].

==Grim Tales From Down Below==

[[Image:GrimTalesloliandguro.jpg|thumb|left|Apparently Bleedman is into both [[loli]] ''and'' [[guro]].]]

[[Image:Saw Puppet.jpg|thumb|Castrating the creepy from your favorite franchises since 2004.]]

''[http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=0 Grim Tales from Down Below]'' is Bleedman's second attempt at [[fanfiction|fan comic]] [[fuck]]upery and is along the same lines in it's ability to take good and make it bad. It's a sickening bastardization of a perfectly acceptable cartoon, if only for that fact that it features a picture of the puppet from ''Saw'' holding a newborn Grim Jr. Although the fact that he named Mandy and Grim's daughter [[Mary Sue|MiniMandy]] is a pretty big fault as well. Real clever, [[douche bag]]. It doesn't even matter to his [[fan]]tards that [http://bleedman.deviantart.com/art/Grim-Jr-and-MiniMandy-31049917 he apparently "borrowed" the characters Minimandy and Grim Jr. from a TARTlet], a slightly less retarded [http://deaddoll00.deviantart.com/ deaddoll00], after which the characters were re-designed to [http://deaddoll00.deviantart.com/art/One-Big-Happy-Family-Redone-129213165 less shittier versions] later on.

[[Image:Mini masterbates.jpg|thumb|The average page.]] 

Oh yeah, did we mention Mandy is now grown up, dresses like Elvira, and is ''married to Grim?'' Yeah, she apparently became a Mayor/Hitman, and Grim fell madly in love with her [[Bleedman#Mandy_Did_WTC|after she did WTC]] so he came to see her in the form of Brad Pitt in the the film ''Meet Joe Black'' to ask her to marry him. [http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=28 You can't make this shit up] (this page also includes a cameo of the two gangster characters of ''Loony Tunes'' fame. [[Jesus]].) 
 
<strike>Just how does one have babies with a skeleton anyway?</strike> So apparently, Mandy is a slut and got knocked up by someone who actually has a penis ([[nobody gives a shit|supposedly Nergal Jr.]]). Grim then gives her a [[WTF|very graphic abortion]] so the dead baby can become his skeleton son. [http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=79 No, really. WTF.] 

It also features [[over 9,000]] [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/24601740/ cameo appearances by Jack Skellington] from ''[[Satan Claus|The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', thus insuring its instant popularity.

Bleedman recently spawned for himself accusations of incest between his [[Mary Sue|fan characters]], Mandy and Grim's children, with [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/47523910/ this piece]. His fans then argued amongst themselves over whether or not Mandy had an affair with [http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=35 Nergal] and whether it counts as incest if you're only half-siblings. The official agreement was that it [[nobody gives a shit|didn't fucking matter]] because it's a fan comic and fans never know [[wtf|what the fuck]] anyway. It's likely Bleedman [[fangirl]]s will accept whatever pedocest he sends their way, because deviantART dote on whatever [[popular]] [[art]]ists draw no matter [[Snapesnogger|how disgusting it is]].
* [http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=107 Turns out] MiniMandy actually DOES [[Incest|like Grim Jr. "that way"]], but [[Lie|he doesn't feel the same way]].

Apparently MiniMandy also got all fucked up by Oogie Boogie and a big robot in a disgusting [[guro]] scene. Once again, [http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=54 truth is stranger than lying for the lulz].

==Sugar Bits== 

[[Image:Sugar_Bits.jpg|thumb|left|That's a lot of underage [[pantyshot]]s.]]

[http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=0 ''Sugar Bits''] is Bleedman's breakthrough work in that it is made up completely of original characters and... An original story, I guess. The comic itself is a morass of pedophilic shit about candy and sugar and all the other shit you'd expect to hear from a guy on ''[[Chris Hansen|To Catch A Predator]]''. This comic was not as well-received by the fans on account of the fact that without the licensed cartoons to pretty everything up and the fact that Bleedman changed the main character's panties to bloomers, Bleedman's [[shit]]ty writing and creepy art become unavoidable. It looks like it rips off elements of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''Chobits'', and every other nonsensical shitty [[anime]] with a shiny veneer and random character designs to hide its bad writing out there. There's not many pages yet but already it's taken a turn for the strange.

[[Image:Bleedman Robin.jpg|thumb|100px|Robin, the flirty little [[Furry|vixen]].]]

An incredibly unoriginal tale about there being "kingdoms" in a magical place called Harmonia that cater to every aspect of human life, from courage to...er...toys. The main focus is a place called Confectionaria. That's about all anyone will get out of it before Bleedman's trademark "lazily telling the story through so much blatant, tl;dr narration that it might as well be an illustrated book rather than a ''comic'' book" style of storytelling bores them to death.

Apparently the sole job of the Confectionarians is to [http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=3 oogle creepy close-ups of the mouths of small children about to lick ice cream]. The main character is the Princess of Confectionaria who, despite living in a magical realm of goodness called "Harmonia", [http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=11 has her bloomers in bunch] over a [http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=13 giant robot man taking away her dead mother]. Her sidekicks are a rabbit [[furry]] named Cupcake [http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=8 who is inexplicably the "''Veggie'' Hut Princess"] (whatever that means), and a [[hardcore]] little ginger bread man ([http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=6 too bad Bleedman still can't bother to draw fight scenes with complicated monsters]) who the Princess created and is in love with her. For srs. Bleedman also decided to write himself into the comic with a self-insertion character. This self-insertion character is a giant, muscle-bound beast that looms threateningly over helpless little girls and carries the bodies of dead women into the night. Scientists are currently determining which parts are wish fulfillment and which parts are the dankest parts of his id slipping into his art. There is now another character named Robin. She is a [[furry|fox]] [[Unfunny|(Oh, like that crappy Disney movie ''Robin Hood'')]]. Robin is obvious fan service to his furry fans for the first scene you see her in, you [http://sugar.snafu-comics.com/index.php?comic_id=46 can almost see her fucking panties. Thus making her "cute"], though in a later comic, she's wearing practically nothing at all. (See right.) It is also easily assumed that she is [[Pedobear|underage]], just like all of Bleedman's characters. EVERY. SINGLE. [[Oneoneone|ONE!!one!]]

==Pedophilia==

[[Image:Bleedfag.jpg|thumb|280px|right|INCEST PEDOPHILIA]]

Bleedman's work often has the aroma of [[pedophilia]] about it. To judge by [http://bleedboy.blogspot.com/2007/01/inspiration.html this blog post], he appears to be an avid [[loli]] fan as well. This was also reverberated by an someone who apparently knows him IRL, who stated in a deviantART something along the lines of "If you saw some of his personal doujinshi, you would be disgusted."

[[Image:Bleedman_pedo.jpg|thumb|His version of Mandy and Grim.]]

[[Image:littlewitch9.jpg|thumb|"My most favorite artist."]]

{{squote|One of my most favorite artist would probably be Oyari Ashito. And If I may caution you most of his works usually involves...little girls as subjects. So if you are easily offended by these kinds of things BACK OFF!!! Yeah...some people might call them sick and weird, and if they think animes aren't sick and weird I dunno what is.|Bleedman, on his above blog post.}}

Lastly, apparently [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/53463172/ this] is what a pedophile from the Philippines looks like. [http://friends.portalofevil.com/sp.php?pi=1000713660 Portal of Evil] collected some of the more [[lulz]]y responses to his photo:

[http://grim.snafu-comics.com/?comic_id=30 This page] in ''Grim Tales'' resulted in Bleedman getting [[ban|suspendwrenched]] for a week on dA. It is safe to assume that [[realitysquared]] was not on this case, as his preference for popular users would've saved Bleedman a week of inactivity.

The events of the incident are unclear, save for someone (possibly RoseDincht to judge by the screencap on the right) objected to the idea of Mandy using Grim's powers to execute 9/11 and Bleedman calling them a bitch in response. This isn't a terribly horrible offense, but dA mods are strict and [[Anonymous|do not forgive]]. At least when they aren't being a clusterfuck of [[fail|failure]].

In a fit of [[butthurt|righteous indignation]], bleedman made [http://bleedman.deviantart.com/journal/8724176/#comments this journal entry] about his suspension wherein he reveals his masterful and not ''at all'' childish (but what do we expect from someone who draws fan comics about Nickelodeon/Cartoon Network shows) plan to thwart the overzealous [[banhammer]] of deviantART. The responses were numerous. They mostly fell into five categories:
*Fans who didn't even know he was suspended.
*Agreement and further indignation at the unjust ruling of the dA admins.
*Fear that they too would be suspended for all the swear words in their journals, comments, etc.
*Lame copycat attempts at "tempting" the mods into suspending them by "accidentally" swearing.
*Suggestions for further ways to censor yourself.

Every few pages or so, there would be a glimpse of the voice of reason, but they were quickly hidden under eighty more responses like this:

===Bleedman's Explanation For His [[WTC]] [[Bullshit]]===
From [http://bleedman.deviantart.com/art/Grim-tales-ch2-p7-8-32583610 the page description] on deviantART.

[[tl;dr]] '''[[lulz]] emphasized'''

"I felt a bit nervous when I started making these pages. And I can truly understand if I have made some people very upset over it .But at least hear me out..
I too am entitled to express my point of view.

I was just trying to find ways how I can relate the concept of the characters with our real world.
I guess we'll start off with Mandy. What I love about Mandy as a character is that she sees the real world, not some idealistic “only good and justice prevails freedom for all and love is everything screwed up” wonderland.
Although she's just a fictitious cartoon character, for me she's someone I can truly relate in our world.
You can’t really blame Mandy for what she did, she’s only doing her job as the Grim Reaper, sure she made the plans. But that’s what every Grim Reaper should do (remember the movie Final Destination) '''At the same time Mandy is a reincarnation of all evil, her existence is the source of humanity’s darkest and most cruel essence.''' While Billy on the other hand and is a representation and a source of man’s stupidity .And because mankind welcomes both evil and stupidity so willingly Mandy is able to carry out her plans.
In short, Mandy simply presented her ideas to mankind and mankind simply accepted it with open arms.
( Because we am dumb and bad humans.)
And as for the natural disasters she came up,
let’s just say she had an appointment with Mother Nature.
These things happen because I believe there is a Billy and a Mandy in all of us, we can be stupid and evil, and with it comes our bestest friend, The Grim Reaper.
We have no one but ourselves to blame.

A couple of themes I want to point out is…
”Will humanity ever learn?” …I guess not.
Is Mother Earth pissed ? I guess so.
That’s what I like about comics, add a pinch of idea based from our real world.
To help remind us of things and never ever forget.

'''Things like our wounds, and I’m talking not just America’s wounds, I’m also talking about Iraq , Indonesia , Sri Lanka and every other country that’s facing hell.
So please look at it not just in your own nation’s perspective''' ,
but through other countries as well.
'''Try to look at the wounds through the eyes of the whole world you self-centered bastards.'''
The wounds are painful and have yet to heal , well it shouldn’t.
Cause it’s only through these wounds that you can become Hard-ass.
It's the only thing that makes you stronger.
Pain and suffering is part of life, it's what my pappy taught me.
These things happen and will continue to happen so
you better get used to it and face it you bunch of wuss.

'''The images I used were not intended as a mockery or a tribute,
but a slap in your face to remind you that life is not all sugarpuffs and candycorns.'''
Life can be cruel, very ,very cruel. Life’s a bitch, and so is Death.

If you feel offended, angry or pissed right now….well ,you should be.
If you feel the urge to email me concerning this issue do so.
Emails, hatemails, flamemails. You have every right to.

Ok I was just kidding about the
“Especially if you’re a wuss who whines a lot” thing on the warning page.
Seriously, speak up.
If you have something to say about these pages positive or negative, or that
I’m a heartless dick, say it. You wanna make a political issue out of this ,knock yourselves out.
Please comment and spare your 2 cents.
'''God bless America.
Allah bless Iraq.''' 

P.S.
'''I took a big risk making these pages, and if I so seriously give a horse shit about my reputation just so people can love me and praise me I wouldn’t bother posting this in the first place.''' But I don’t, so hate me, flame me.
However, I still give a damn about respecting other people’s feelings and opinions.
So I want to apologize to everyone I offended.
I’ll be posting a poll on Deviant art whether these pages should stay or not.
'''Technically the grim tales storyline can go on without it.''' (''ed note: So why did you do it in the first place you [[fuck]]ing [[idiot]]?'')"

==Cartoon Network trolls back==

[[Image:Fusionfall.jpg|300px|right]]

Sooner or later, Cartoon Network realized Bleedman's popularity and how his fans were buying various forms of the network's copyrighted characters. Instead of suing him into creating original characters, the Jews in charge decided to [[Burn|steal Bleedman's art concept, hire game designers and programmers, and created a new MMO called '''Fusion Fall''']] (moar liek '''Fusion [[Fail]]''', [[amirite]]?). 

Now that Cartoon Network has launched their own shitty online gaming platform, with all their characters [[animu]]'d up the asshole, it now is attracting the same weeaboos who have loved Bleedman and his [[CP|art]] for years, and with any luck Bleedman will be out of options (except creating his own stories, or just drawing constant child panty shots panel after panel and drawing porn of his characters like the pedo that he is).

Besides the game's animu fucktarted[[shit]], by some fluke miracle of programming, '''Fusion Fall''' is ''absolute bullshit''; even by [[MMORPG]] standards. The game tosses out grinding and click based combat for stuff that's just as lameass. Cartoon Network will overcharge the shit out of everybody if anyone(nerds) wants to get past level four with a full skill set. The only redeeming factor about the game is the [[asking for it|character customization options]] to [[raid|dress up]] as a [[fag]].

And since Bleedman was using Cartoon Network's copyrighted characters to begin with, [[lol|the bitchy fucking baby faggot is unable to do a fuck about it!]]

i assume you don't understand the underlying meaning in bleedman's artwork. he's not the pedophile. most people who like anime like some sort of perversion. anyway, there is a hidden intelligencs that persuades me to believe that he is mocking the veiwer.|One of his [[Retard]] fans trying too hard.}}

Anyone who believes Bleedman is a good artist are, without exception, [[fandom|TV addicts, basement dwellers, engrish-speakers]] and either complete [[virgin|virgins]] or completely [[Pedophilia|in easy business]]. Those know even less about art than a black person knows of science, and will [[fail|try to take you down]] if you [[Common knowledge|state the obvious]].

Bleedman's fans are easy to troll because, being [[lolcow]]s, they all believe that bleedman is [[serious business]]. Facts are:
* Not a single serious artist gives a fuck about Bloodgay.
* Bloodguy doesn't need to respond, if you [[Common knowledge|say he draws crap]], his legion of retards will defend him in a [[lulz|never-ending scene]].
* Bloodman gives a fuck for his [[fandom|followers]]. [http://youtube.com/watch?v=pMsYQSuiMPI Srly]. Even so, [[whores|they still praise him]].
* As stated by [[teruchan|a fellow pedophile]], fandom thinks that popularity is better than being a good artist.
* Bleedgay's talent is overrated.
* His [[unfunny|fanboys]] are [[pedophilia|pedos]], and his [[16 year old girls|fangirls]] are [[Unrealistic Expectations|untalented]].
* He [[h8|hates]] [[deviantart|dA]], and similar pages. But [[attention whore|he stays]] for the [[buttsecks|love]] of his lovely watchers.
* This idiot don't post anything back because it would [[divide by zero|increase significantly]] his [[drama whore|faggotry]].
* This guy is so lame, that [[Chris Hansen|our friend Chris]] doesn't give a fuck.
* This fatass doesn't fit inside of any [[car]].
*Bleedfag has the smallest [[dick]] in the universe.

===Bleedman Clones & Wannabes===

Take [[shit|manure]], cover a weeaboo with it, and chop it so you can replenish the orifices. Blend this together, adding much [[fail]], a lot of [[faggotry]]. Give the mix to a dog. When the dog excrete this, give it to a [[tubgirl]], and let her process it trice. Give it to a [[deviantart|dA admin]] disguised with a 3% of gin (so they won't notice), and after 2 drinks it will be barfed by such. Remove the power factor of the admin so the mix can ferment [[drama]]. Add any [[shitty art|drawing method]] and pour it hot. Now, you've got the prime matter of a Bleedman-Fan:

[[Image:Masterbleedman.gif|thumb|left|The lord of underage pantyshots has principles? [[O RLY]]?]]Why develop your own artistic style when you can use someone else's shitty style? Bleedman won't stop you.

*{{deviantart|ovisniger}} actually draws in a different style every so often, but Bleedman has his [http://ovisniger.deviantart.com/art/to-Matt-70833348 favorite style of draw!]
*{{deviantart|erix3423}} rarely posts anything that doesn't look like something Bleedman drew. He says, "I'm still a rabid fanboi of Vinz and will continue to lick his ass whenever I can :3" [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2536227/622484753 It's true]! Observe his yammering when someone asks to see his own style. [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2536227/607963335 He makes Bleedman sound like some sort of god]. (Other great drama to be found on that thread, too.)[[Image:Gamefan's_Evolution.gif‎|thumb|right|GamefanPPG is so awesome!<br>His works improved so much that a lowly peasant can never tell the difference!]]
*{{deviantart|pig100}} claims to be "[http://comments.deviantart.com/4/2536227/594638292 practicing Bleedman's style]." Looks like [[MS Paint]].
*[[Blazesonic]] is one of the more infamous wannabes.
*{{deviantart|Griddles}} This pedophile retard without talent is the one responsible for the shitty plot of the powerpuff girls doujinshi and also delivers each one of Bleedman's porno drawings on notfourchan. He also love to have sex with all his girls <strike>inviting all his friends to join the fun</strike> but does not share because not only is he a sick fuck, he is a selfish one. He bothers and obsesses over gamefan because deep inside he loves him and wants his cock. His only dream in life is to be fucked by gamefan in the ass, and he's even gone so far as to comission porn about the two of them from Bleedman. Pretends to hate the cock because he's a closet fag. He also likes to steal characters and claim them as his,bitch all about, then use people to draw his uggo mary-sues.
*{{deviantart|GamefanPPG}} is another [[pedophile|sick fuck]] who prefers underage [[animu|pixel pussies]] to the real thing. He spends most of his money commissioning [[dickgirl|futa]] [[pedophile|CP]] from Bleedman to fap to, also faps to his own [[not|original]] [[shit|artwork]] and is <strike>[http://gamefanppg.deviantart.com/art/Yeah-Right-152049079 a] [http://gamefanppg.deviantart.com/art/Broken-Heart-173559591 complete] [http://gamefanppg.deviantart.com/art/Confusion-175133491 emo] [http://gamefanppg.deviantart.com/art/Sigh-182041912 bitch]</strike> Baleeted because he is a pussy. Former fuck buddy of Griddles, simple invoke Griddles' name for lulz.
*{{deviantart|electronic-musix}} Oh god. ANOTHER rip off. She likes to try to draw bleedfag style, fails at it, and has these Angst! Mary Sues that are based off of Bleedfag's stories. She also likes to suck Griddles' tiny [[cock]] and be his bitch. Request everyone to draw her Sues, also has some rip off gay ass comic coming up featuring her in them. When you tell her off she uses some stupid picture of her ugly character whos a total copy.
