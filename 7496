In the [[100_years_ago|fall of 1987]], Eddie Lee Sausage and Mitchell D. moved into a cheap pink stucco apartment at 237 Steiner in the Lower Haight district of [[San Francisco]]. The building was known as The Pepto-Bismol Palace. There they lived for two years next door to a pair of repressed [[homosexual]] [[alcoholics]] named Peter Haskett (1928-1996) and Raymond Huffman (1931-1992), and a scary frequent visitor known only as "Tony". 

Peter and Ray were neighbors from hell.

{{quote|Within a week of our arrival, we were exposed to what would become a dependable routine from our next door neighbors: evenings charged with belligerent rants, hateful harangues, drunken soliloquies, death threats, and the sound of wrestling bodies thumping against the wall that separated our apartments.|Eddie Lee Sausage}}

Eddie Lee and Mitchell D. soon began making audio recordings of their uncouth neighbors. Initially these were only for the amusement of their friends; but as their fame grew, they attained a cult status among a generation preceding Encyclopædia Dramatica's habitués. You will find that the recordings have a similar appeal as ED. They represent the [[historical]] roots of [[Internet]] [[drama]] from an era when the Internet consisted of little more than [[bulletin board system|BBS]]s. They were recorded in the mid to late [[1980s]], but of course [[Encyclopædia Dramatica|Æ-tan]] wasn't born until December [[2004]].

Eddie Lee and Mitchell D. did it [[for the lulz]], even if [[lulz|the term]] didn't exist at the time.

The collection is known as '''Shut Up, Little Man!''' because Peter so often shouted those words at Ray.

==Audio==
Here are three short audio samples to give the flavor.
*{{audio|crucifix-4.mp3|The crucifixion of dinner (about 0:28)}} 
*{{audio|onfloor-4.mp3|On the floor again (about 0:45)}}
*{{audio|stealv-6.mp3|I want you to quit stealing my vodka (about 0:19)}}
Further audio clips are available at [http://shutuplittleman.com/galleries.php?pg=sound the Shut Up, Little Man! audio clip page]. Go listen to them right now. The only reason they're not embedded on this page is that they're too large, and you really need to have heard them to understand the derivative works in the next sections of this article.

==Quotes==
Canonical quotes from Peter and Ray.
