What is Love?
[[Image:What is love.gif|frame]]
"'''What Is Love'''" is a 1993 'hangover from the 80s' dance track by the singer [[GNAA|Homosexual Nigger]] (aka Haddaway), popular at shitty 90's clubs. Recorded in the early '90s, it later experienced a revival as the song from the Saturday Night Live "Roxbury Guys" sketches, which were later made into the 1998 feature film A Night at the Roxbury.

The song is about a nigger who does not know what love is (this is obviously true as niggers only rape). The niggers gf however is a dominatrix who hurts him for thrills but the nigger doesn't want to be hurt no more.
