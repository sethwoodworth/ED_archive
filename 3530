Guriin

'''Guriin'''/Green/Gureen/Aoi/ao/midorii is a rather new [[tripfag]] in [[4chan]]'s [[/a/]].  He came to /a/ during July, spouting off about an /a/nime club, and general newfaggotry. What makes Guriin different then the other [[newfag]]s that visit /a/ is that he hasn't stopped with his retarded ideas. From a thread linking game, to his views on [[Anonymous]], he is always posting his retarded ideas. Every day. Since July. He hasn't let up once.

Recently, the [[faggot]] has gained a friend. Or, at least, another tripfag who helps him. Red !18kDYAChPE, adopting the color scheme that Guriin wishes [[Anonymous]] to use, has been more or less the faggot's yes-man, supporting and bumping every one of guriins threads so they hit front page. The recent support hasn't gone unnoticed either. Now Guriin is on a retarded rampage, trying to convert every tripfaggot he sees into his color brigade. However, he's not the brightest tool in the shed in that he openly posts the tripcodes for people to mimic (shoujouhi#scarlet, for example).

[[Some argue]] Red is the same person as gurrin, as gurrin often [[roleplay]]s and holds entire conversations with his [[schizophrenia|other personalities]]. (Red even calls him [[weeaboo|guriin-sama]]). Others believe gurrin is just the most persistent troll ever, since it's really hard to believe someone could be so stupid to the point of not being able to take the hint that you're [[rape|unwelcome]]. 

Note: Red is now banned. His tripcode is Red#Pokemans. Put it in the name box for [[lulz]]. He now goes by Rojo !0iQzFUmOxI

No matter what he does, he'll get at least 20 [[sage]] replies per post he makes. It doesn't matter what the post is. He could post a cat and get sage bombed. He infuriates all of /a/ for purely existing. Red has made their anger double. Guriin quickly took over Tonberryking as /a/'s most hated Tripfag, and arguably, /a/'s greatest troll right after food anime and anime_expert.
