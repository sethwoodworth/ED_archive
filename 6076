Original Content

The most elusive thing on the [[internets]] and a precious resource. As rare as white dog turds, and as valuable as [[gold]] to the <s>[[Mexicans|Spaniards]]</s>  [[Jews]], watermelonz to the black personz, and [[CP]] to [[4chan]]. Ironically original content is not welcome on most of the net, most OC gets thrown out because it is not a meme or it called a forced meme. 

'''Original content''', or as it is referred to as "OC", is what the cutting-edge [[dramatician]] uses to generate [[lulz]]. The purest and most intoxicating lulz can only be acquired through the generation of original content. All lulz generated through documented and established methods are cut with such impurities as [[old meme]], [[unfunny]], and [[AIDS]]. Most attempts to generate lulz through original content [[fail]], because most people [[OTI]] are [[fucktard]]ed or [[aspies]].

Everything was, at one time, original content, even our old friend [[Goatse]]. Since the invention of the tubes the internet has been a filthy recycling ground for everything [[IRL]]. Popular culture enters the greedy mouth of the [[INTERNET HATE MACHINE]] and is mangled within the putrid bowels of legion. [[in the ass|Out the other end]] comes a [[tubgirl|stream]] of [[chocolate rain|garbled junk]] that becomes a repost of a repost of a repost, leading to hordes of [[gaia]]fags/[[newfag]]s swimming in the collective [[shit]] of [[Anonymous]], thinking they're bathing in the [[drug#LSD|ambrosia of the gods]] while the rest of the internet moves on to [[porn|bigger and better things]]. [[R9gay|Attempts at actively promoting the creation of original content]] [[fail|rarely work]].

Original content, when used in conjunction with [[satire]] by someone with [[genius|half a brain]], is the anti-[[GRIDS]]. It is, therefore, what [[ED]] needs moar of. Ironically, most original content is [[Special:Log/delete|thrown out]] becuase it is not an old regurgitated meme from a chan board, and winds up slipping off the end of the earth while everyone focuses on the same unfunny [[Copypasta|copypasta]].

Original Content is also a term tossed around by old fags to refer to their old copy pasted memes. Like nothing will ever be as funny as typing [[scroll up]] or emailing someone a video of a [[Dancing Baby|dancing baby]] over your AOL connection.
