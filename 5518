<i>This article is about the [[an hero|school shooter]]. For the Finnish porn star, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Saari Henry Saari].</i>

'''THE FINNISHER: RELOADED'''

'''Matti [[KOTOR|Juhani]] Saari''', <s>is</s> was a [[13-year-old boy|22-year-old]] [[Finland|Finn]] who became [[an hero]] and the [[You Win the Prize|new Finnish champion]] on [[last Thursday|September 23rd]], 2008, [[winnar|beating]] [[pekka|Pekka Eric Auvinen's]] Finnish record from 2007. Matti Saari (codename: '''Wumpscut''') shot at least 10 unarmed girls at the [[irony|School of Hospitality]], a vocational college in '''Kauhajoki'''. Some [[old media]] first reported that he was still alive, but he managed to [[An hero|beat the game.]] He is considered to be the most famous Finn in [[over 9000]] years, other than the Moomins.

Just like his idol [[pekka|Pekka Auvinen]], he posted similar [[YouTube]] videos some days before.  According to Finnish [[old media]] the local police had interrogated him on the nature of the videos just the day before but [[Fail|decided not to confiscate his weapon]]. JewTube deleted his videos a few hours after the shooting because people from [[4chan|a certain online community]] started viewing them.

He managed to get '''ten frags''' and '''three''' wounded, a new [[Finnish]] [[A winner is you|record]]! Original research showed that it was due to disappointment in the [[Olympics]], unfortunately, school shooting is a national American Sport, not an Olympic sport. [[Some argue]] that Matti was inspired by two Finnish Olympic [[an hero|heroes]], shooting medalists [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics#Medalists Satu Mäkelä-Nummela and Henri Häkkinen]. Other old media reports states 11 casualties, putting Matti Saari on the 7th place on the all time leaderboards.
Bonus points go out for trying to burn down the school.

==YouTube Channel==
Like all modern an heroes, Matti had a YouTube channel. A few days before the shooting he uploaded some videos of him shooting. The [[Cops|police]] interrogated him because of that, but decided he's the right kind of a guy to be carrying lethal weapons.

And suddenly there was war we didn't remember it
A long time forgotten there suddenly was war
And suddenly there was war our children are dead
Burnt in the ruins that were left by war

War

And suddenly there was war and the mothers they screamed
For revenge and reprisals for another war
And suddenly and suddenly
And suddenly there was war with spoiling and death
And you fight alone if there's another war

Whole life is war and whole life is pain
And you will fight alone in your personal war

War

This is war!

== Internet dating ==

It seems like Matti Saari was trying to date online. He listed his interests as [[porn|"computers"]] and [[rape|drums]]. On his YouTube profile he listed computers, weapons, beer and [[Fapping|sex]] as his interests. (There is no evidence that he ever had [[Fapping|sex]] with anyone other than his mitten).

Google translation of his online dating profile:

== Evidence of being a [[retard]] ==
Last Thursday, the [[Fail|Finnish police]] have released a report titled "Laboratorioanalyysijatodisteidenpsyykkinenhäiriövuonnasaari" (the Finnish word for "Laboratory Analysis and Evidence of Mental Disorders in Mr. Saari"). In the report, Mr. Saari was deemed legally [[retard]][[ed]]; the reasons cited were:

* Mr. Saari liked "Saw"
* Mr. Saari liked "Saw II"
* Mr. Saari liked "Saw III"
* Mr. Saari was [[Sweden|swedish]]

The fact that Mr. Saari did not mention liking "Saw IV" or "Saw V" was not considered mitigating evidence, as those films were made after 2005, and no movies reach Finland until 5 years after they opened in American theaters.
