Malber

Every [[Wikipedo]]<br>
in [[lulz]]-less [[TOW|WP-ville]]<br>
liked having [[autism]] a lot, and most of them [[Chris-chan|do still]]<br>

But the Malber, the Malber who lived<br>
[[ED|just North of Wikipedo-ville]],<br>
sure as hell did NOT!<br>

Malber hated autistics and [[aspies]]!<br>
His hatred was especially wild.<br>
Looking at the [[Wikipedia|WP]] [[Bureaucratic Fuck|Admin]]'s Noticeboard<br>
his temper grew quite vile.<br>
'Cos he was sadly seein' people defending, [[Mistress Selina Kyle]].<br>

He knew Selina an asspie,<br> 
got on with fewer people as time went by.<br>
So then without lube, the [[bureaucratic fuck]]s [[Buttsecks|thrust a banhammer up her ass]]<br> 
... her ass, her ass, her pretty little ass.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive65#Asperger_syndrome]<br>

He sat there reading slowly, hotly hating the Wikipedophiles.<br>
Messages defending her, came flooding in their piles.<br>
They said she had asperger's; she can't help it so hell,<br> 
and [[Kelly Martin]] who blocked her should know this all too well.<br>

So the Malber he said, "No! She was just faking! She's only self-diagnosed!" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive65#Outside_comment];<br> 
and the [[wikipedo]]s went bright red, wilting at the prose.

The trolling ignited a flame war.<br>
[[Ambi]] and other cabalists chose to whore.<br>
[[Phil Sandifer]] went so far as to lecture them, what a fucking bore.<br>
He said "It's an unfortunate result, then, that Asspies, are rather less suitable to rule."<br>
Then hanging over his keyboard, he proceeded to drool.<br>

Not long after, Selina went to [[Wikipedia Review]] and did a whole lot.<br>
That really pissed off [[The Wikipedia Jews|the wikijews]] whose [[SlimVirgin|leader]] created a plot.<br>
They appointed Malber as the "honoured troll," a cabalistic [[troll]] in shining armor.<br>
That was when they couldn't stand to see him without [[Banhammer|admin powers]] any longer. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Malber]<br>

In his Request for Adminship, SlimVirgin lathered on praise until her underpants became sticky.<br>
Saying, "Support. Malber has been very helpful in opposing nonsense from [[The Wikipedia Review|troublemakers]], both on and off-wiki."<br>
She said, "He's got an excellent balance of edits between articles, article talk, user talk, and project space."<br>
Then, "He's smart, has a lot of common sense, and I think he'll make a good admin." as her vote brought more support votes from Wikipedos all over the place.<br>

When Malber's RFA lost, he got pissed off and decided that from Wikipedoville he'd finally go.<br>
Good old Malber, trolling Wikipedia Review like a true pro.<br>
Malber is known to Wikipedia Review as [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=&showtopic=8977&view=findpost&p=41839 "Public Enemy number 2".]<br>
Which really sucks for Malber, as he is behind the infamous [[Grace Note]], who spread the rumor that all WR staff denies the killing of six million Jew.<br>
Although [http://gollyg.blogspot.com/#4882108144192747879 Grace had the advantage of a blog to brag about trolling in],<br>
Some examples of Malber's Wikipedia Review trolling include this gem:<br>
[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=135&hl= "There's that awful troll malber and evil SlimVirgin saying awful nasty things about her. We must help her!"]<br>

So WR banned Malber and to Wikipedo-ville he went,<br>
Still unbannable and on a personal crusade he was bent.<br>

He tried to regain posting rights,[http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Blissyu2&diff=prev&oldid=1997233189]<br>
But they banned him from the sites.[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=11968]

His first order of business was for everyone to buy<br>
The notion that Daniel Brandt looks and stinks like a homeless guy. [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Daniel_Brandt&diff=1996990280&oldid=1996990269]<br>

His second order of business was really quite textual,<br>
He convinced people that [[Ann Coulter]] was a [[Shemale|transsexual]]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_transgender_people&diff=61846591&oldid=61614329]<br>

His third crusade was well-thought out and had the wisdom of sages.<br>
It was to spread [[Harry Potter]] spoilers, especially by putting them in "Requests for Adminship" pages.<br>

Unfortunately, admin WJBscribe got the ending to Harry Potter spoiled.<br>
And after crying, vowed revenge as his blood boiled.<br>
So he banned Malber until a month would pass.<br>
But then WJBscribe doubled it once Malber committed [[mod sass]].<br>

Feeling bored, WJBscribe filed a checkuser to find any socks.<br>
Malber, of course, isn't some loser who is going to avoid editing during his blocks<br>
And nobody ever fucking does.<br>
When socks were found...<br>

And what happened then...?<br>
Well...in Wikipedo-ville they say<br>
That the Malber's large [[e-penis]]<br>
Shrunk three sizes that day!<br>
And the minute his penis didn't feel quite so tight,<br>
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light<br> <!-- Yes this line actually is in http://www.everwonder.com/david/thegrinch/story.html -->
And said he revoked his GDFL licenses! Thinking that was possible at all!<br>

Then to "[[Porn|Wikimedia Commons]]" his browser did fall<br>
Which is where people upload pictures without a care<br>
Of things like their [[:Image:Gynecomastia_001.jpg|Gynecomastia]] and worse<br>
As free license for the whole world to share.<br>

The Malber tagged all his uploads and said to delete all of it<br>
But [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=delete&user=&page=User%3AMalber then WJBscribe put a stop to that shit.]<br>

"I will have none of this", said Malber the troll,<br>
As he [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMalber&diff=151903525&oldid=151715388 revoked all of his edits], GFDL and all.<br>
TOW however, did not like this at all<br>
And [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Malber banned his ass], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMalber&diff=151918983&oldid=151918804 page protection] and all.<br>
