<!--

Are you a scientologist? Are you here because you're angry? 
Perhaps you've been angry for a long time.

    * If it weren't for RTC, you'd be OT by now.
    * RTC is downstat. Apply the condition or suffer the consequences.
    * No one has the right to sell you Scientology. It belongs to the entire human race.
    * It's time to make a choice. RTC, or your next endless trillions of years.
    * PR can't hide the Truth anymore. RTC is destroying Scientology.
    * Where have all the millions of trained auditors gone?. Ask RTC.
    * If you don't remove RTC now, you may have no Scientology left soon.
    * "The work was free, keep it so . . ."  Who said this and how can we best apply it in real life?
    * Will you make it this lifetime? Not if RTC has anything to say about it"
    * RTC has made Scientology the opposite of what LRH intended.
    * RTC is squirreling LRH books. Compare recent and earlier editions.
    * You are responsible for the condition you are in. Don't let RTC tell you what to do.
    * The entire bridge is on the Internet. You don't have to pay anyone for it.    * 90% of your contributions are going toward legal fees. Outpoint?.
