42 is the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. However Given that Life, the Universe and Everything are totally meaningless it must be concluded that 42 doesn't actually mean sweet fuck all. Additionally, you can't know both the answer AND the question to life, universe and everything, according to some dickhead that laughed himself to dead, so you're now pretty fucked.

==The ultimate question to life the universe and everything==
Well, it's been discovered.

The ultimate question to life the universe and everything: '''Why don't white rappers put on blackface so they can pretend to be black and get more street cred?''' <s>Wait I thought it was Seven Times Six</s>

Though [[some argue]] that the very existence of [[Chris-chan]] himself is the ultimate question and 42 is the age at which he both dies and loses his virginity (not counting sex with the joooolllaaaay doll).

==The Origins of 42==
In truth, 42 is the number that was invented so that counting could progress beyond the stale, boring and pedestrian number 41.

[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Its popularity as a divine number stems from ''The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy'', a bunch of dubious radio plays, a record, a text based adventure game and awesome series of books written by Douglas Adams]] at least 100 years ago. In this retro multimedia massacre the number 42 was given as the [[Meaning_of_life|answer to Life]], the Universe and everything by the super-[[computer]] "Deep Thought" ([[moar]] [[liek]] ''[[head|Deep Throat]]'', [[amirite]]?). This began one of the oldest of the [[old meme]]s, having been a staple of [[basement-dweller|basement-dwelling]] [[nerd]] culture since [[Before the Internets|those dark days that preceded the Internets]]. 

42 is revealed in the story to be the answer to the question "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?" This is one of the cheapest tricks in humor, namely [[uncyclopedia|nonsense]]. [[Basement dwellers]] later noticed that 9x6 = 42 is, in fact, correct if the calculations are done in base 13. Douglas Adams is said to have commented, when some goddamn [[nerd]] mentioned this to him, "[[fuck you, I'm a dragon!]]"

I always knew there was something fundamentally wrong with the universe.

[[Some argue]] 42 has something to do with Lewis Carroll or monks or some shit. Douglas Adams argues otherwise[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/browse_thread/thread/e7de673ee904f89a/d1064f7b27808692?#d1064f7b27808692]. In truth, 42 is 7 times 6.

==42 IRL==
While ED [[newfags]] [[You are doing it wrong|claim that 42 is simply the answer to "6 times 7,"]] the true meaning is far more [[Idiot|complicated.]]  The movie, (as well as the [[Old Meme|book]]) which, by the way, clearly defines [[Dolphinsex|dolphins]] as [[Diustin Biber|gheii,]] also states that the correct answer is [[Truth|"What is the question?"]]  Thus, [[Head|Deep Thought,]] a [[Windows|"supercomputer,"]] designed Earth, an even more complex [[Fail|computer]] which could supposedly discover the question.  Unfortunetly, Earth got [[Rape|surprise buttseck'd]] by some [[Mexico|aliens]] 5 minutes before the program was complete.  [[Bullshit|All of this happened IRL, and you know it.]]

==The resurgence of 42 in popular culture==
With the recent [[I came|"release"]] (albeit more like the cinematic equivalent of a still birth) of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] [[movies|movie]], a whole new generation of [[13 year old boy]]s are discovering "42." These mall-going [[Runescape]] players just love to toss themselves over 42 [[OL]], using it as an answer to complex or stupid questions whilst failing to realize that the joke died decades ago and really wasn't very funny in the first place...

All true Hikers know that the origin of 42 was actually in the ''radio'' series and not the book. I sure know where my towel is, I used it to vomit in while watching that total abortion of a film.

42 is also one of the 6 numbers that gives [[John Locke]] the power to fuck up your shit!

== [[Godwin's Law]] of 42 ==
On [[slashdot]], as a discussion approaches ten posts, the probability that someone will write "obviously, the answer is 42!" approaches one. This has proven to be true in varying degrees elsewhere as well.
