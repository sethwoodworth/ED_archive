'''Sarah Manely''' is a mother with serious issues when it comes to making decisions regarding the internets. This came to the fore just after Hallowe'en in November 2010 when she published a photo of her son all [[trap|trapped up]] as Daphne from Scooby Doo and then blogged that he was a [[Faggot]]

LULZ ensued when Manley's blog went [[Viral]]: [[Christians]] shit their pants, 
[[lesbians]] creamed themselves, and [[Nambla]] began a lottery to send a lucky
member to Missouri, to find out if Manley's toddler hid Scooby Snacks under
his skirt. Oh, and a Forbes blogger called Nerdy Apple Bottom bitch [http://blogs.forbes.com/carolinehoward/2010/11/05/my-son-is-gay-is-a-lesson-in-bad-mommy-blogging Sarah Manley] a "bad mother." (Also, some say that [[AutoAdmit]] [http://www.xoxohth.com/thread.php?forum_id=2&thread_id=1470530 derived numerous LULZ].)
