Literature
[[Image:Bookshelves.jpg|thumb|Literature is [[serious business]].]]
Literature, from the ancient Latin <i>littera</i> meaning: "Great. Now we have a way to keep accurate tax records." While <i>literature</i> can technically be used to denote any written work, prose, [[poetry]], or shit band lyrics, it usually refers to writing of lasting quality that holds artistic merit. This excludes any string of words you will encounter scrawled on the [[internet]], save for scraps of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Sylvia Plath]] that [[goth]]s and [[16-year-old girl]]s have pasted in their [[cutting]] [[journal]]s.

**"A Clockwork Orange (1963) Author: Anthony Burgess “In the first 20 pages, Alex and his lackies beat a guy senseless and rob him; they steal a car and trash it, they get into a vicious gang fight; they attack a couple at their home, destroy the husband’s life work (his book, A Clockwork Orange), beat him and his wife senseless, and rape the wife. This really ticked me off.”

 "'You can't write literature,' Tiddle said.
 'You don't know literature.'<br>
 Something clicked. 'You know,' I said,
 'you may be right.'<br>
 But Tiddle was rolling. 'So I flame morons
 like you who would dumb us down.'"<br>
