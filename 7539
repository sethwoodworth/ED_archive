Six Degrees of Adolf Hitler
__NOTOC__

A fun new craze sweeping the [[internets]], '''Six Degrees of Adolf Hitler''' is the name given to a game played by utilizing a [[wiki]]'s internal links.  One plays by starting at a [[Special:random|random page]], then attempting to navigate his/[[NGOTI|her]] way to the wiki's article on [[Adolf Hitler]] with nothing more than links to other articles.  It's a pretty [[fun]] time-waster when you're [[online]] if you have [[No life|nothing better to do]] and a love of [[Nazi]]s.

==Rules==
The name originates from the idea of '''Six Degrees of Separation''', that one crackpot [[theory]] developed by some stoned [[Europe|Hungarian]] [[woman]] back in the late '20s that states any two people on Earth can be connected via six or less intermediaries.  Basically, the idea is that you can trace any person to another person via [[social networking]].

Online, this theory has taken on new life in the form of a sort of game played on [[wiki]]s.  The general goal is to make your way to the page on [[Hitler]] in six or less steps.  The step-by-step breakdown:

#[[Special:Random|Random article]]
#Make your way to Hitler in 6 steps or less
#[[???]]
#[[PROFIT!]]

Example: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternal_Gift_Farm,_Maryland Paternal Gift Farm, Maryland] -> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland Maryland] -> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States United States] -> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II World War II] -> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler Adolf Hitler]

[[Nazi|Sieg heil]]!  Congratulations, in just four links, [[you|you've]] successfully linked Hitler to some random-ass home development in Maryland about which nobody gives two shits.  Presumably, the only way to truly win is to actually land on the Hitler page when clicking the random page button.

Of course, you don't have to use Hitler as your destination of choice; any topic will do.  Hitler's just naturally the most common.  Nor do you have to start with a random page - say you'd like to show that two articles are related by fewer than 7 links; you can start with one of those.  But why would anyone want to use anything other than Hitler?

==Where to Play==
[[Image:Hitler Mudkip copy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mudkip|Hitlerkips]] are always relevant.]]
Obviously, the most popular playing field is the [[English]] [[Wikipedia]], due to its size and scope of containing such a vast quantity of [[SNCA|useless bullshit]].  As such, [[the game]] is also well known as '''Six Degrees of Wikipedia'''.  Actually, it's probably known ''better'' as "Six Degrees of Wikipedia," since people usually try to avoid mentioning Hitler in polite conversation.  

But for more of a challenge, you can play on wikis that have fewer articles and less internal links, thus making it harder to reach Hitler in six clicks.  For an even bigger challenge, go to a foreign Wikipedia that's written in a [[Moonspeak|language you don't even understand]]!

Or for easy mode, you can play right here on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]].  However, this is ill-advised, since even the most unrelated [[ED]] articles are very likely to contain healthy amounts of praise for the [[Holocaust]] and a dozen or so [[Jewish]] jokes.  When playing on ED, it would be best to go for a different end goal.

==Variations==
Or, rather than simply trying to make it in 6 steps or under, you can race others on the web to the destination, the winner being the one who gets there in the least links.  Just start a [[thread]] in your favorite web community, and race the other forumgoers to the agreed-upon goal.  This particular variation is known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace Wikiracing].

There is also a similar version of this game played [[IRL]] that predates the Hitler version called '''Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'''.  The goal of this trivia game is to connect any actor with Kevin Bacon, the linking element being the films in which two actors have both starred.  This game apparently started after Kevin Bacon once claimed that [[USI|he had worked with everyone in Hollywood]].  However, this version [[fail]]s because it requires the players to know a bunch of [[shit]] about film history - and because Kevin Bacon is a [[fag]].  But [[srsly]], it is actually a real thing.
