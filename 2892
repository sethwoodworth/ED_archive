Faulty Logic
'''Faulty Logic''' refers to a set of [[Golf|eighteen holes]] in the arguments typically presented by [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Republican]]s and other [[Mouth breather|mouth-breathers]]. As a [[flame war]] technique, it is surprisingly ineffectual against those most vulnerable to it, because telling people that they're stupid doesn't stop them from believing in an [[God|invisible old man]] in the sky. It can still be used casually, however, as an effective tool for putting your opponent on guard and costing them extra mental anguish by making them think too hard about things. Example:

:''Prima: If we don't ban the furries, next we'll have the diaperfurs in here.<br>''
:''Secunda: '''BZZZT!''' Slippery slope!''

By and large it's a great way of working really hard to make yourself look like a complete nerd. Nonetheless, here it is for posterity.

!BZZT!
|-
|''False Analogy''
|[[711chan]] has an /i/. [[4chan]] doesn't have an /i/, and they get on fine without it.||4chan users are too busy posting [[THE BEST]] and bitching about each other to organize.
|-
|''False Premise''
|Everyone wants to get laid. GHB will get you laid. Therefore, everyone should buy [[Aqua Dots]].||Not everyone wants to be [[pwnt]] in the ass by Bubba.
|- 
|''Red Herring''
|Wikipedia admins are great. They revert and delete new pages every day!||Assumes good faith on the part of the Wikipedos.
|-
|''[[Ad hominem]]''
|Roger shouldn't be allowed within two miles of children. He's a furry.||Ad hominem, although totally justified in this case.
|-
|''Genetic Fallacy''
|Roger shouldn't be allowed to go to Anthrocon. He's a diaperfur.||Simular to ad hominem, and likewise totally justified in this case.
|- 
|''Appeal To Pity''
|Children are abused on the Sea Org by locking them in the hold, and you call us "Protestfags!"|| Similar to red herring. Regardless of [[Child Abuse]], holding up a "LONGCAT IS LONG LOL" sign still makes you a fag.
|-
|''Appeal To Ignorance''
|12chan must have no pedophiles at all - nobody there has ever been [[v&]] for [[cp]]!||[[Pedobear]] is a crafty beast.
|-
|''Either/Or Fallacy''
|If we don't put all the black people in prison, they'll steal our televisions.||Assumes that putting black people in prison will stop them from stealing televisions.
|-
|''Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc''
|People get [[CP]] from [[12chan]]. Therefore, reading 12chan turns you into a pedophile.||''Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc.'' Many 12chan users read ED too - [[Yes|does reading ED make you look at CP?]]
|-
|''Concurrence Fallacy''
|[[Emo]] kids listen to [[My Chemical Romance]], and many of them become [[An Hero]]. Therefore, listening to My Chemical Romance makes you kill yourself.||Not everybody who listens to My Chemical Romance kills themselves. But they should.
|-
|''Personified Abstraction''
|History tells us that six million died during the Holocaust.||"History," does not "Tell" us anything, revisionist sympathizers do.
|-
|''Ill-Founded Generalization''
|I surf 4chan every Saturday. I can tell it's a great place to get pictures of cats.||If you went on Friday you may come to the conclusion that it was a furry site.
|-
|''Non-Sequitur''
|People who surf 12chan are bigger pedos than those who surf 4chan. Roger surfs 12chan. Roger should be arrested as a pedophile.||Roger may have already run a magnet over his hard drive.
|-
|''Circular Reasoning (Tautology)''
|Joshua is a Jew because he always tricks people out of money.||The correct syntax should be Joshua always tricks people out of money because he is a Jew.
|- 
|''Begging The Question''
|Places like [[Wikipedia]] should require email login.||Conceals a second argument. Wikipedia ''cannot'' ask for email login, or Jimbo would not be able to walk around with a giant moral hardon. The argument is really "Wikipedia should require email login."
|-
|''Equivocation''
|Anonymous is morally neutral. Sean says "But I really care about Chanology." Therefore, Sean is not an Anon.||Anonymous contains moralfags, protestfags, newfags and oldfags, but the most annoying of all are the ones who whine "Internet hive mind!" and tell people where to get off.
|- 
|''Appeal To Wrong Authority''
|Sarah went to [[ITT Tech]], and she says big colleges like Harvard aren't that great.||SERIOUSLY wrong authority.
|-
|''Slippery Slope''
|Don't let your kids watch Rescue Rangers. They'll end up going furry for Gadget and asking you for a fursuit.||One thing does not necessarily follow another. But it does. It totally fucking does.
|-
|''Shifting Burden of Proof''
|PROVE ME WRONG||It will get you banned on 4chan, PROVE ME WRONG.
