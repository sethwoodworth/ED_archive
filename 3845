IAWTC

'''IAWTC''' is a common [[internet]] contraction for "I agree with this comment" or "Jew". It is used to quickly and efficiently show what a [[fag|yes man]] you are to the commentor. Another common usage is for your [[friends]] (in reality, your [[sock journal]]s) to rapidly "iawtc" your [[pwn]] of a [[loser]] to [[a winner is you|be a winner]]. It's meant to promote harmony in the Greater web forum and [[LiveJournal]] Co-Prosperity Sphere.

It's also frequently expanded or altered for humorous effect, as in "iawtac" (I agree with this agreeing comment) or "iawtf" (I agree with this furry/faggot/fatty).
