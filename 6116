P2P
{{WP80}}
'''P2P''' is an acronym for <s>[[Pedobear|Pedo-to-Pedo]]</s> Peer-to-Peer which describes a decentralized way to steal from the [[RIAA]], the [[MPAA]] and the [[Warez|BSA]]. It's basically an anarcho-communist economic system.

== Origins ==
For [[at least 100 years]], [[Jews|cheap]] bastards the world over have enjoyed stealing from [[The Man]].  With the advent of the [[internets]], [[Goons|pirates]] can now stick it to [[W|The Man]] without having to haul their [[Fat|gelatinous]] husks out of their [[basement dweller|parents' basement]].

== [[Drama]] ==
[[Image:Cop pwn.jpg|thumb|The Man's always gotta keep a [[pirate]] down.]]
The various business associations and groups mentioned earlier have been fighting piracy and [[The Game|losing]] for [[at least 100 years]].  Not until a [[Feminazi|bitter]] [[cunt]] named [[Jews|Hilary Rosen]] got a [[Zeta_toy|burr]] up her ass about [[Napster]] did piracy become a real issue.  After [[Metallica]]'s Lars Ulrich discovered the [[internets]], he realized that [[poor]] people and [[Molest|kids]] were downloading his precious [[Shit|music]].  After much legal wrangling and [[Angst|nerd rage]], Napster was shut down and the P2P networks rose from out of the ashes.

== Piracy Today ==
[[Copyright infringement|Grokster]] and others have fallen in the wake of continued assaults on piracy, but the internet always finds a better way to commit [[e-theft]].  [[BitTorrent]] is the de facto standard protocol of pirates everywhere now, and the old standbys [[IRC]] and [[Usenet]] soldier on as the most reliable source of [[mp3]]'s [[Movie|moviez]] and [[warez]].  Some users don't even have cable TV service anymore, as they download all the TV shows and movies they watch. 

In early [[2008]] the [[Australia]]n high court got pissed off at p2p websites for providing downloads for the banhammered TV show [[Underbelly]]. After much whining and threats of [[lolsuit]]s they eventually realized there was nothing they could do, something that displeased Australia's most violent gangs.

Now in November 2010, [[Malaysia]] wants to take a swing as well with a ISP Liability act to be tabled in Parliament by the United '''maggots''' Malay National ''terrorists'' Organization. P2P users to be hanged, drawn and quartered.

== Other Use ==
P2P also stands for pay-to-play, usually when involving [[MMORPG]]s. For example, ''[[EverQuest]]'' is considered P2P while ''[[Maple Story]]'' is not, but [[Nobody|who cares]]?
