'''Catnarok''' is the long-awaited epic battle between [[Longcat]] and Tacgnol, or [[Tacgnol]] dna Longcat. This cosmic battle has been foretold since the beginning of time. 

==Harbingers and signs of what is to come==

[[Ceiling cat]] will warn [[Anonymous]] that Catnarok is nigh. It will be the meow of doom. The [[Internet Hate Machine]] will begin to operate at maximum force. [[Limecat]] will not be amused. [[Happy Snake]] will be happy. The pool will be closed. [[Raptor Jesus]] will go extinct. [[Auschwitz]] will be fired up again. Gay porn will be posted on every MySpace page. All iPods will be [[An hero|stolen]]. Curtains will be drawn. [[Corruption of LOL|LOL will be corrupted]]. No [[Buy a dog|dogs]] will be left to buy. All [[furry|furfags]] will be yiffing in hell. [[IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZER|Lazers will be charged]] to [[Over 9000|previously unknown levels.]]

Longcat and Tacgnol will meet at the chosen ground on [[Caturday]] and begin their long, sacred battle. This battle between light and darkness will endure for a thousand æons, but the passage of time will seem like just a few seconds. It will be an even match, a [[pun|purrfect]] balance, so neither can fail. It will thus be an [[epic_win|epic win]], as the world is cleansed of [[Scientology|faggotry]] and [[AIDS]].

==After the end==
