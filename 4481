{{moar|everything}}
The '''Kamikaze''' is a type of [[Flame wars|flame war]] where you drag yourself down along with your opponent. It generally involves a combination of [[Flame wars#Salt the Earth|salting the earth]] (yours and your opponent's) and invoking [[Godwin's Law]] on purpose.

While this is seen as a last resort by experienced flamers and other "real" users, it is commonly used with either [[fake journal|throwaway journals]] or journals preparing for [[fake death]] or [[IRL]] [[suicide]].
