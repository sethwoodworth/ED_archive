ChaCha
[[Image:Typicalchachaguide.png|thumb|right|Your run of the mill guide at ChaCha.]]

[[ChaCha|CrotchCha]] is the latest [[lie|contender]] for [[Google]].

The difference between ChaCha and most search engines is that ChaCha supplies you with an [[Aspie|online guide]] to help you find [[Lolicon|relevant results]].

USATODAY.com says that "One day searchers may quit Googling and start ChaCha-ing" [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2006-09-06-google-chacha_x.htm]. This is about as likely as aforementioned searchers asking family members to stand over them as they [[masturbate]] to see if they're [[YOU_ARE_DOING_IT_WRONG|doing it right]].

Besides, should ChaCha ever become a serious threat Google would just buy them out like they did [[YouTube|JewTube]]. 


==ChaCha doesn't do guides anymoar, I keep saying but some fag keeps reverting.==
They still call them guides, but they only respond to SMS queries.

sheria: Welcome to ChaCha!
You: Hello Sheria
You: This is kind of embarassing but
sheria: hello, how are you today
You: I'm good but a little nervous, how are you?
sheria: fine don't be nervous
You: You see...I'm just barely legal and my boyfriend wants to have sexual intercourse
sheria: and there is nothing to be ahamed about
You: but I don't know how
You: also, we're homosexuals, you may have heard of us
sheria: yes I have
You: I asked KimberlyJ but she said she didn't know how homosexuals do it
You: and she transferred me to you
You: It's kind of embarassing to be telling so many people I don't even know
sheria: well the good thing is you don't know us
You: Yeah, it'd be much worse if I was asking my parents
sheria: so its less stress for you
You: I'm Catholic
sheria: I am a christian
You: Oh gosh
sheria: and do not agree with your lifestyle
You: This is why I was nervous
sheria: but I do not wnat you to get into something that will be bad in the end
sheria: no pun intended
You: So you won't help me?
sheria: i will say if you are not ready to make that step wait
sheria: and I will send you to a site that can help
You: I'm ready...mentally. I want to pleasure James.
You: It's just that I'm not sure how exactly homosexuals have sexual intercourse.
sheria: how do you know that you are homosexual
sheria: I have a friend and she said it kinda comes with know that that is who you are
sheria: think about it
You: I was born this way
sheria: and hold a min while i try and assist you
You: Even when I was little when I would meet other boys I found attractive
You: I would get flustered
sheria: you are catholic
sheria: do you attend church
You: Yes, I attend church
sheria: and have you spoken with your priest
sheria: regarding you perference
You: No, I've already told you that this is embarassing for me
You: But James and I do believe Jesus is God. Well, not God himself but you know what I mean. The son.
You: God made us this way
sheria: then you and james need to read his word regarding what he feels about the lifestyle
You: We have, and we're not entirely sure if the Bible is being interpreted properly
sheria: in my faith we belive in the holy spirit and in other spirits good and bad
You: I mean why would God create people for him to hate?
sheria: and believe that there are spirits that can be prayed off and that is one of them
You: We're not posessed. We're very kind and good people.
You: James works in a nursing home on weekends and I help out at the local homeless shelter on holidays.
sheria: there is such a thing as the devil or enemy and his job is to steal kill and destry and anything contrary to God is to him
You: So you believe the devil is the cause of all homosexuality?
sheria: is good to him is what i meant
sheria: yes
sheria: and murder and diease
You: I don't understand why God wouldn't stop him though. I mean God created him, he was originally an angel.
sheria: that is why God said he bears our sickness and diease and we claim it and he wil take it
You: Couldn't he just as easily destroy him?
sheria: he gives us feel will and everything we do is a choice
sheria: let me ask you
sheria: he says that we are in this world but not of it
sheria: when satan was knocked here he was the put here on earth
sheria: though its all Gods world this is where he rolls
sheria: and God is a God of order and will set things right in time but we have free will and an option to follow him or not
sheria: the path to God is good but narrow , many rather the broad cause its popular
sheria: Are these results sufficient?
You: The links?
You: Or the paths?
sheria: the links
sheria: the narrow is always God
You: the link talks about a boy and a girl...
You: James and I are both boys
sheria: hold a sec
You: However I do believe that homosexuality is the narrow path that many have chosen if that is what you are talking about
sheria: avert.org
sheria: is a area for all
You: oh I see there is a sidebar, thank you
You: was that the question you wanted to ask me?
sheria: if it is ok i would like to pray for you, that you and james get a Greater understand of what God has for you both
You: Thank you
sheria: talk to your priest just to get direction on everything
sheria: I do love you and you have a great day
You: I think I love you too.
You: You're very wise.
You: Are you a man or a woman?
sheria: i am a lady
You: Oh...then I could never love you like that
sheria: lol
You: but as a neighbor
sheria: i like that
sheria: i am married any other way could get me in trouble
sheria: :)
You: Oh, haha.
You: Well I don't know...
You: if the devil is ridin' dirty here on Earth
You: Couldn't God just stop him?
You: Why would God make us suffer?
sheria: He does not he shows us the way i see it like this, 
God gives a us something that satan does not a choice to do good or bad.
We all know hte difference but our choice is where we take the stand . 
Satan is bent on evil alone. He wants to take as many of us with him because it makes is fire a little lighter. 
His fate is already know but its ours that is not
You: I've always felt that God was the one who created me and put me on the path of a homosexual.
What he had planned for me as my obstacles in this world. 
I've never thought the devil would be the one who made me this way.
sheria: so to get to know God and what he wants for you is important to make that choice 
so that you can have a choice and not the one this world lays before you only, 
why do you think they wanted the bible out of schools and things like that , 
it forces many to see that what they do and how they live there lives is not the way God wants it
sheria: do you believe in angles
You: Yes
You: Angels are who told Mary she was pregnant even though Joseph never made sweet love to her.
sheria: when satan fell he took a 3rd of them with him
sheria: so not to say he came and tapped you and said you will be homosexual
sheria: we have things called generational curses and they are passed down
You: are those like AIDS and mental retardation?
sheria: i did not understand it till i read the bible and was free of some during a weeked with the church
sheria: something like that
You: I've read much of the Bible but I always interpreted it as God destroyed the sodomites 
because they did not care about the poor
You: and not because they were homosexual
sheria: no they swapped wives, men with men , women with women, 
and they worshipped idols and there was only one family that followed what 
God said and they were the only ones that got out
sheria: I have to go though
sheria: I loved talking to you
You: Will I ever see you again?
sheria: please go to your priest or a christian church ( pent, baptist) ask questions and 
ask for the location they are there for that reason if they are true men and women of God 
they will explain and make you welcome to learn of God
sheria: LOl

[[Some argue]] that ChaCha is a shitty idea, as it takes [[At least 100 years ago|at least 100 times longer]] than a [[Google]] search and gives you maybe two results tops if the topic happens to be easy. It also has some "No pr0n policy," which  ensures the breakthrough search technology is only applied to [[Nothing|appropriate searches]]. 

However, ChaCha is an endless source of [[lulz]], as nothing is more fun than [[trolling]] [[ppl]] at random. Because of this, ChaCha employees are paid under minimum wage to put up with [[13 year old boys]] [[shit]] all day.


But unfortunately the [[sick fucks]] have removed the endless source of [[lulz]] by removing the guide search entirely, leaving only a [[Google|simple]] search, due to [[Copyright infringement|research and development]] into Text Messaging services.  It was [[Capitalism|cheaper]], even though that's hard to conceive, given the Guides' [[shit|pay rates]].  All [[Your Mom|guides]] are now being [[Scientology|retrained]] to work with [[Retards|users]] and their cell phones.

ChaCha has recently tried to [[theft|acquire]] a larger share of search results from [[God|Google]] and so have tried a flagship of a service, in which Guides are given a better pay rate, in exchange for putting information in their blogging system, so that Guides' pages get hits in search results, which gives users a chance to search with their [[Google|Guides]].  The only problem with this is that the Guide system no longer exists.

Hello (Insert Name Here),


We're looking for some of our most passionate Guides who have a deep knowledge about anything and would be interested in consistently writing about it.  Are you an expert on home-schooling?, Do you love to write about the best restaurants in your area? Do you have helpful tips to share with others about your local community? If you do then you might be the kind of person we're looking for.

As Esther said in her blog,

"We want to drive traffic to all the services and to find ways to spread the news about the unique value ChaCha offers by providing answers from people who are passionate about helping others. One of the ways that we can do this is by appearing in the top search results. In order to do this, ChaCha is partnering with Compendium Blogware, who will provide a tool for Guides to create blogs and for ChaCha to gain prominence in search results. We can “win” certain keywords, which will drive InfoSeekers to our Guides’ blogs on specific topics. Once they read the blogs, they will see the ChaCha search box where they’ll have the opportunity to search with a Guide."


Having a blog is a great way to share your love and knowledge with everyone and if you are selected to be one of our test-pilots for our ChaCha blogs you'll find out what a rewarding experience it can be!

If you're interested in maintaining your own personal ChaCha Blog, click on the link below to complete a short survey.  We will be starting with a small pilot group before making them available to all Guides.  If you are selected to be a part of this group we will get you blogging!

Thanks!
