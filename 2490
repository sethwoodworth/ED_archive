'''Dustin Joseph Kelly''' (aka. '''DustFungo''', '''Fungo''', or more popularly known, '''Funghole'''), born July 30th, 1985, is a [[Loser|popular]] [[Snuff|video-editor]], [[Techno|musician]], and general laughing stock in the [[Silent Hill]] [[fandom]] who thought it would be a good idea to name himself after a [[Goatse|dust-clogged yeast infection]].

== Internet Faggotry ==
[[Image:Dustyspringbreakwooooo.png|thumb|left|Fungo flashing tits in an attempt to gain moar attention.]]
He is most well-known on the [[interwebs]] as an [[Angry Video Game Nerd]] and [[Nostalgia Critic]] rip-off who bashes old games that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]] and reviews movies via his alternate personality [[Schizophrenia|Señor Fungo]]. The feedback from his videos pointed out his [[Too lazy|lack of research]] and his [[Cock|specifically-shaped]] haircut [http://www.gametrailers.com/user-movie/alone-in-the-dark-1992/332287#comments_top]. He is also known for ripping copy-written content from the first few Silent Hill games, [[lol wut|conducting self-interviews about how he did it and asking people to credit him before taking it]]. He labels his name on everything likely in a desperate attempt to become [[e-famous|famous]].

Dustin is a Silent Hill [[oldfag]] and has been in the community since 1999. He was a part of the first big Silent Hill forum that [[Shit nobody cares about|nobody cares about]], along with other [[Batshit Insane|equally stable fans, including Vixx and Krist from the Silent Hill Heaven forum]]. Sometime down the road, [[Shameless self promotion|he decided that he would start mooching off of the series to give himself a name]], hence his [[Copyright|totally original complete soundtracks and rips]] and the birth of his site, [http://silenthillmedia.net/home.htm Silent Hill Media]. After the release of Silent Hill: Origins, Dustin started to get [[butthurt]] over the series and refused to rip any content from the newer games, [[Weeaboo|constantly bitching about how "Americanized" they were]]. [[Fanon|He has outdated and disproven theories on the games that supposedly explain why the new games don't fit the main canon]]. Although these theories ignore plain evidence and pull from vague or non-existent sources, [[Your argument is invalid|they are completely true and override what]] [[Konami|Konami says]]. This [[Retard|logic]] propelled Dustin to begin working on his [[Propaganda|documentary]].

On his old [[forum]], Silent Hill Talk, he would neglect updates, leave users in the dark about his site decisions, and eventually left the forums to move in with his [[Christfag]] [[Not gay|boyfriend]] in [[Arizona]], Rosseter. After coming back to the forum [[over 9000]] years later, he tried to reassume his role as owner, in which many [[lulz]] were had. Eventually he gave up altogether with the forum, posting a [[Emo|heartfelt]] post about [[Sob story|how hard his life is]] and how the forum coding is [[Too lazy|too hard to understand]] before merging it with another site.

[[Come at me bro|Dustin is well on his way to having an internet posse, so ''BACK OFF!'']]

== Personal Life ==

Dustin has never held down a [[Loser|steady job]] in his life and has most likely [[White trash|never worked above minimum wage]], as he never takes any of his jobs seriously. He bounces from state to state, never living in one place for very long before he spends all of his rent money on [[video games]] and [[alcohol]] and his dad has to come help him move, noting [[I am disappoint|how worthless his son is]]. It is unknown whether he is a [[manchild]] [[Chris-chan|because he doesn't know any better]] or [[Chris-chan|because it's easier than growing up]]. Dustin's [[Fail|inability to grow]] [[Teenager|body hair]] is likely the result of this. Dustin usually puts any money he aquires toward shit accessories for his consoles or to buy more factory-sealed games that he will most likely never even play. Dustin loves [[Utada Hikaru|J-pop]], [[animu]], [[Final Fantasy VII]], [[LOST]], and [[Futurama]]. He also has a [[Retard|vast knowledge]] of the [[Wapanese|Japanese language]] and can [[Google|translate the language into English]]. He used to make fun of [[Christianity]] and [[Fail|videotaped his mother praying in an attempt to troll her]], but recently became a [[Christfag]] himself in an attempt to get [[Anus|pussy]]. Dustin is very self-conscious about his [[Acne|acne scars]] and commenting on them or calling him [[ugly]] results in him [[Crybaby|throwing a fit]] [[Emo|and taking some time to be alone]]. Bringing up his [[Fat|weight is likely to cause the same reaction]].

The idea of having friends does not interest Dustin, [[Douchebag|unless he has the most to gain from it]]. He is known to flock to other people when he needs advice and expects them to manually fix his problems, but when anyone wants to talk to him in return he ignores them to play more [[Portal]], only to come back later [[Crybaby|playing the victim]] after he realizes that they're pissed off. He is also a master in the art of using people, which he exercises on his "[[Troll|fans]]" and site partners.  Oh, and he adopted a [[cat]] from a shelter and had it for less than a week before sending it back because it wanted him to [[love|pet]] it.

He also has a tendency to tell people how to do things that he isn't able to do himself. This is due to his attention-seeking narcissistic behavior and need to out-do everyone else.

== Sex Life ==
[[Image:Fungoonfungoaction.jpg|thumb|The ultimate form of attention whoring.]]

Dustin has admitted to being "[[Attention Whore|bi-sexual]]" on his old forum, but quickly deleted the thread after some time, claiming that now he was [[Faggot|straight]]. He has been known to boast about his prowess in the art of [[fellatio]], stating that [[cum]] doesn't taste that bad. He has also [[Buttsecks|taken it up the butt]] from his co-worker when he was still employed at [[Taco Bell]], [[Fatass|his favorite place to eat]]. In his "[[Faggot|straight]]" sexual encounters, he has bragged about how [[Lolicon|he likes his girls "innocent" virgins, ignorant to sex and has boasted about how tight they are upon contact]]. Dustin most likely faps to [[Shotacon|shota]] in an attempt to justify his real lust for [[Mitchell Henderson|little boys]].

==Dating Life ==

It is well known that Dustin uses Silent Hill forums as [[Online Dating|personal ads]] and will scope out for [[Rape|people to date]]. Most of these relationships suffer from his [[unwarranted self-importance]], [[domestic violence]], lack of interest in participating in the relationship and ignoring it to [[Cybersex|cyber with Rosseter]], [[Dickgirl|unrealistic expectations]], embezzlement of [[money]], and usually end when they find his collection of [[gay]] [[child porn]] downloaded from [[Limewire]]. This is mostly because he feels that his life follows the events of [[Shit|Eternal Sunshine: of the Spotless Mind]] and shitty [[Disney]] fairytales. Dustin likes to think of himself as the [[Gaston]] of these relationships, despite that he is in fact the [[DERP|drooling]] [[Chris-chan|little autistic girl]] in the corner that puts marbles in her [[vagina]]. He also has a tendency to propose on the first date. In order to date this [[Fail|successful]] [[Acne|dream boat]], you must:
* [[Barely legal|Be under the age of 20]]
* [[13-year-old boy|Know as little as possible about sex]]
* [[Rape|Be open to trying new things]]
* [[Insane|Be bipolar and have a personality disorder]]
* [[Playstation 3|Understand that his PS3 comes before you]]
* [[Homosexuality|Understand that Rosseter comes before you]]
* [[Chode|Have a penis]]

== Fungo Review ==

{{quote|your a﻿ fag|'''Fungo Review viewer''', noting Dustin's [[Rape|charm]].}}
{{quote|holy fuck﻿ is this guy annoying|'''Another viewer''', pleased with [[Plagiarism|Dustin's work.]]}}

Sometime in mid-2009, Dustin grew tired of recording himself playing [[Silent Hill]]. Thus he decided to do something completely different and original: record himself playing old video games! Dustin started out reviewing survival-horror pioneers, such as D and Alone in the Dark; [[Too lazy|actually, that's all that he's really reviewed.]] His reviews tend to be bastard children of the [[Angry Video Game Nerd]], the [[Nostalgia Critic]], and the [[Irate Gamer]], in that he reviews older games that have a well-known reputation wrapped in a [[Lost|poorly acted, boring little package]]. He also has [[Original Content|his own theme song and music]] throughout the reviews, but since it's shitty stock [[techno]], it is obviously crap. Dustin's reviews are usually lacking in proper info and rarely mention any pros, which the archetype of his work, [[AVGN]], can do with games that actually are really bad. This is likely due to the fact that he is [[too lazy]] and always does half-assed work. He also uses [[Sony Vegas]] effects constantly, most notably when he references being on hallucinogenics in almost every video review he makes. [[wut|According to these videos, Dustin thinks that licking beetles and taking Gas-X pills will produce an LSD trip.]]

<center><youtube>A5nyTss1JuI</youtube></center>

After only making a few video game reviews, Dustin began reviewing new movies under the persona of [[Racist|Señor Fungo]], [[Lies|which totally didn't rip-off Nostalgia Critic's Bum Reviews.]] He dresses up in a dirty [[pedophile]] [[Jesus]] [[cosplay]] and talks in a really bad Cheech Marin parody voice, creating [[anti-lulz]] of epic proportion.

<center><youtube>RBFJGN8brgY</youtube></center>

As of February 2, 2011, he hasn't posted a new review in close to a year. His viewers keep asking for updates, but with his track record, he will most likely never make any more because they're [[Crybaby|too hard]]. Despite this, he keeps making false promises about new reviews that never get uploaded and [[Retard|his fans]] lap it up. This buys Dustin more time to [[felch]] with Rosseter.

[[Shit nobody cares about|Dustin has recently made the claim on his FungoReview channel that his review videos will continue]] [http://twin-perfect.com/ on TwinPerfect's website.] [[Unrealistic Expectations|Whether this is more of Dustin's horseshit or is actually true is unknown.]] You can expect to find the same [[Shit|quality]] you have seen in past [[Ripoff|reviews]].

== TwinPerfect and The REAL Silent Hill Experience ==

After the announcement of Rosseter and Dustin's Silent Hill Documentary [[at least 100 years ago]], they finally released it on [[Halloween|October 31st, 2010]] to coincide with the release of their production site, [[Twincest|TwinPerfect]]. It debuted as "[[Shit|The REAL Silent Hill Experience]]" spanning [[Lame|two-and-a-half hours]] and was broken into 13 segments of [[oldfags]] sitting on a couch [[Nerd Rage|nerd raging]] about why [[Wapanese|Japan is so amazing at everything]]. In the process of the release, they [[LOL|threatened to block people]] from their [[YouTube]] channel for criticism and gave direct responses to [[Less than three|ass licks]]. Eventually the new Silent Hill producers and the strategy guide writer of Silent Hill 2 and 3 caught wind of the videos and criticized them, resulting in Ross and Dustin backing into a corner like [[Summoner Yuna|little Wapanese girls]]. 

[[Image:Trsheposter2.jpg|thumb|left|"It will go over what happened to Team Silent and why Akira Yamaoka is a jerkface who makes medicore music"]][[Image:Lol narcissism9.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gay|A re-enactment of Rosseter and Fungo creating TwinPerfect]] ]]
{{quote|Essentially, they go into their review of the current SH games with a preconceived notion that they are not going to like the game, nor do they want to like the game. [[Oldfags|Without starting from a clean slate, or merely judging the game on it’s own merit, they choose to evaluate the game with a negative spin, and a completely non-objective opinion]]. In reality, they are doing themselves a disservice, as they come off as biased and overly jaded [[Fanboy|fan-boys]] who won’t be able to give any non-Japanese developed Silent Hill games a fair shake. [[Too lazy|As opposed to a professional reviewer who can objectively view the game for what it is, rather than basing their opinion on factors which have no bearing on the quality of the game]].|'''Devin Shatsky''', Silent Hill Producer}}

{{quote|Devin and I are both impressed by the production values on display in these videos. Clearly a lot of time was spent planning and then creating this documentary. [[NO U|But while it does show a large breadth of Silent Hill knowledge, it also skips past some obvious holes in its conclusions]]. [...] [[Racist|Lastly, I found their impersonation of Akira Yamaoka really offensive]].|'''Tomm Hulett''', Silent Hill Producer}}

{{quote|Regarding the videos, if they really said the things you indicate herein then it sounds like they are heavily misinformed. [[Too lazy|Which could have been avoided by emailing me prior to airing them]].|'''Dan Birlew''', strategy guide writer}}

They edited out the section where they [[Crybaby|blamed the writer for the series lacking in more Wapanese content]] and edited the criticism out of the producer's responses. In the end, they pull the internet is [[Facepalm|serious business]] card and [[How Do I Shot Web?|make shit up to back up their ideas]]. Realizing how bad it is that [[Nice try|the people that matter don't even like their project]], they edited the videos to look less pathetic, but the [[nerd rage]] is still present.

== Recent Life ==

[[Image:Totallydidntgoogleit.jpg|thumb|Researching is too hard.]][[Image:Fungowhoops.jpg|thumb|left|Whoops.]]Dustin has also recorded himself playing Silent Hill 2 and edited it together to make a "[[Shit|movie]]". Again, [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|he gives himself too much credit]] to the point of treating it as [[Theft|his own film]], even releasing a [[Facepalm|director's cut (despite the fact that he also made the first cut) and a DVD]]. He also shows that he is still [[Snapesnogger|unable to handle criticism]], [[Usagi Kou|ignoring people that don't boost his ego]]. The game's original soundtrack is clipped out and replaced with music that he found fitting, [[Shit|which basically means it sucks]].

Great [[lulz]] were had from [[Ego|crediting himself in the intro]], using what was meant to be his name in Japanese, but really translated to the word "knock". Dustin states the error must have been from his "[[Lies|translation research or it may be a problem with the Japanese character pack installed on [his] computer]]", despite the fact that if you [[YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG|ask Google to translate "Fungo" it gives you]] [http://translate.google.com/#en|ja|Fungo "nokku"]. This only further proves that Dustin is, in fact, [[Fucktard|full of horse shit]].

<center><youtube>oj3r6M8siLk</youtube></center>

{{quote|Speaking of unfamiliar, I changed the music up to breathe new life into the scenes. So for new and old-comers, it was a new experience. [[nope.avi|I felt I could bring out and achieve the real emotion of every scene by inserting fresh organic remixes of original songs, and I think I did this quite well]]. Every piece of music from the Hotel until the end of the game is a prime example of this. By doing this, people really felt the true emotions the scenes were trying to convey. [[Emo|Some even admitted to crying towards the end]].|'''Dustin''', [[trying too hard]].}}
