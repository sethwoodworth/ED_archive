==Quality Programming==
Merrill Howard Kalin <s>is</s> '''was''' the host of a small-time cable access cooking [[Teenage Kings of Werribee|television program]], broadcasting in Palatine, Illinois. His... "energetic" [[Exploding_Whale|cooking style]] has made him an [[internet celebrity]], and was particularly popular for a time on [[7chan]]. Between his awkward, [[Michael_j_fox|jerky movements]], cross-contamination, and persistant, strangely erotic groans, he displays a [[Real Ultimate Power|surprising proficiency]] with [[cutting|sharp objects]].

The Merrill Howard Kalin show is primarily a learning endeavor. He teaches the proper way to chop "Cucumbels", how to prepare lettuce (namely, by bashing it against an [[Iraq|unwashed]] poultry cutting board), and how to use a measuring cup. As a learning-focused program, Merrill reminds the viewer [[TONIGHT_WE_DINE_IN_HELL|never to cook alone]] and to never use a knife"EEEEEVER!"(himself, quite  the expert on the subject, being the only exception). Merrill has even devised his own complex dish-rating system, moving from "[[omg|good]]", to "[[zomg|so good]]" to "[[omgwtfbbq|marvelous]]" and nothing else.

===The Show===

==Talents==
Merrill enjoys impersonations, [[sandwich]]ing them between repeating his own name and [[drunk|slurring]] cooking terms. In a typical half-hour episode, it is uncommon to hear anything less than a baker's dozen. He does everyone from [[W|presidents]] and movie stars to assorted [[shit nobody cares about|cooking celebrities]], all of which sound like a frightened retarded manchild, except his impression of boo boo which is eerily accurate. Aside from that, The only impression that sounds somewhat close to the actual thing is that of Jimmy Stewart. It has been described as how Stewart would sound if he suffered brain damage by falling into a meat grinder. 

==Response==
Critics have scoffed at those who would use Merrill's program for their own [[lulz|twisted amusement]]. Detractors, however, point out that the station programmers were the ones who supplied Merrill with both cameras and knives. As Always, Kalin is his own worst critic, and often scolds his own work on air. Listen carefully, as any mistake is met with a silent "[[raptor jesus|Jesus Christ]]", or "[[YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG|Not like that]]". Merrill also calls himself a jerk during the show.

==Death==
We at ED have received the sad news that Merrill Howard Kalin [[Zerg Rush|died suddenly]] at the age of 45 in his home in Ohio on June 20th, 2008. Please create your own chicken and Jell-O dinners to commemorate a loss of mass [[lulz]]. See [http://www.legacy.com/chicagotribune/GB/GuestbookView.aspx?PersonId=112237897 here].
