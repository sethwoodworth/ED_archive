'''O rly?''' is an [[old meme]] from [[ytmnd]], which eventually found its way to [[4chan]] and [[Something Awful]]. While on SA, the only part of the meme was the phrase itself, but it soon spawned [[at least 100|a bunch]] of [[image macro]]s, with the most popular being the O RLY? owl. On YTMND, it had a similar fate, however it was accompanied by [[Techno|M&H band's]] cover of [[Old|Popcorn]].
Recently, O RLY has spread to lj [[icon| icons]] and the like. The O RLY? owl is a snowy owl [[image macro]] popular on the [[internets]].

Situations in which one does not know their [[facts]] call for the usage of O rly. When [[Godwin's Law]] comes into a situation, O rly can be used to combat the accuser.

==Standardized Response==

In order to combat the widespread evil and [[gay]]-ness of O rly, scientists in labcoats invented their own rival term: [[ya rly]]. This term can be used to shut up any whiny [[troll]] or [[16-year-old girl]] on the [[internets]]. 

*"''O rly?''" "''Ya rly''" 

But it doesn't end there. there is an additional response you can use when someone says "ya rly."

*"''O rly?''" "''Ya rly''" "''NO WAI!''"

The correct response to ''this'' is "[[Yahweh|YA WAI]]". 

*''"O rly?"'' ''"Ya rly"'' ''"NO WAI!"'' ''"YA WAI"''

The correct response to ''this'' is "Okay."

*''"O rly?"'' ''"Ya rly"'' ''"NO WAI!"'' ''"YA WAI"'' ''"Okay."''

==Foreign Versions==

The [[Russia]]ns, envious of the [[British]] [[O RLY?]], made up their own version of O RLY to make themselves feel important. The Russian O RLY is the word PREVED!, which is in some crazy foreign language [[noone]] has ever heard of. 

PREVED! has a [[Pedobear|bear]] instead of an owl, and it what you say when you spot something surprising going on, such as [[Brotney Spears]] naked from the waist down, or some [[people]] [[fuck]]ing in the woods. 

The [[Japan]]ese use an almost literal translation of O RLY with the same picture of the owl, except they use the text, "MAJI DESU KA?!". But mostly japan doesn't give a fuck.

The French, in their ignorance of [[English|any legitimate language]], persist in having a city named [http://www.nextag.com/Orly--zz2724095zB4z5---html Orly], not to be confused with [http://www.sitesatlas.com/Europe/France/Orleans.htm Orlyans] or [[New Orleans|New Orlyans]].

The Mexican, using their weird Mexican Spanish, state this as "neta?" and the answer to this should then be "si, neta".

==Other Notes==
The O Rly owl was immortalized as a clothing item for [[Gaia Online]], an anime role playing community populated by people who weren't good enough for [[LJ]] (or any other community on the internet, for that matter).

The photofag who took the original O Rly owl photo has asserted his ownership, causing drama on Wikipedia.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_talk:Orly.jpg#Copyright] Anyone who tries to make money from his photo will feel his wrath.[http://wigu.livejournal.com/125035.html][http://www.fohguild.org/forums/screenshots/18888-orly-owl-copyrighted.html]
