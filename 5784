Ninjas can't catch you
{{Forced Meme}}

[[Image:Ninjatemplate.png|thumb|right|Exploitable]]

'''Ninjas can't catch you''' was a [[newfag|Fisher Price My First Meme]] kit dropped into /[[b]]/ in late [[2008]], cruelly stolen from the '''Dr McNinja''' [[webcomic]], reducing the amount of win on that site into a 5-second [[b|shitshorm of unoriginality]], a fascinating study into how a board can snatch fail from the jaws of win.

One has to admire the workmanship with which '''NCCY''' was constructed as an insta-meme. Simple graphic, adaptable in seconds to avoid the thread [[404|falling off the front page]], and has [[ninja]]s in it. Amazingly, though (or maybe not that amazingly), '''NCCY''' became a victim to its own lowest comment detrollinator frequency combined with an atmosphere in which starving /[[b]]/tards will set upon any [[original content]] in a feeding frenzy.

The thread was pages long within seconds, with everyone adding one more turd to the mountain with gems such as "Ninjas can't catch you because [[300|THIS IS SPARTA!]]" "Ninjas can't catch you if you're [[OVER 9,000]]!" "Ninjas can't catch you because YOU ARE A PIRATE!" and so forth. The moral of this sad story? Just let original content happen, or your fucking website will turn into [[Something Awful]].
