In June [[2010]], grumpy old [[buzzkill]]ing troll [[Joe Lieberman]] introduced a bill to the [[US]] Congress that will install a big, red [[Your_mom|easy]] button in the Oval Office of the White House, so that Presidents can turn off the [[Internets]] with the flick of the wrist in the event of a [[9/11|national emergency]]. Never mind that the Prez already has the power according to [[old meme|Telecommunications Act of 1996]] that says the President has broad powers to simply shut off any and all regulated telecommunications if he/she/[[Barack Obama|Chosen One]] deems it necessary for national security. He can't shut off [[ED|a website]], but he can shut off any and all wireless or wired [[Internet]] access.

He got the idea when he was catching up on old [[South Park]] episodes and saw [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/1206/ Over Logging] from [[2008|season 12]].

What he failed to realize is that [[Dan Kaminksy]] thinks he already has this kill switch, which he plays with inbetween drinking [[tequila]] and masturbating to XSS. In one of the most fucked up jokes on the Internet, Dan Kaminsky was given a part of the key. Somehow, people forgot that Dan had his shitty shell box owned up due to wordpress bugs (blogging, lol).

If there ever is a kill switch, it will more than likely be abused...assuming that whoever is in charge knows how to use a [[computer]].  Like anyone [[Ted Stevens|over 60]], they will need the help of their children to use it.

Ostensibly, the proposed kill switch is to prevent a major [[DDoS|cyber attack]] from [[blaming China|Chinese hax0rs]] in an attempt to clog up the tubes with cheap, toxic Chinese [[pr0n]]s and bring down the Internets [[9/11|Twin Towers]], but the real purpose of the kill switch is to stifle dissent [[lie|for the children]] and to protect the [[China|cultural heritage]] of [[1337|American Exceptionalism]] that we [[bullshit|so rightfully deserve]]. Also, since Lieberman is a [[technophobe]] who hates progress, it's part of his evil plan to take us back to a time of [[old meme|traditional values]] like black & white TV, rotary dial phones, and [[vinyl|record stores]].
