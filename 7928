Susan Boyle

'''Susan Boyle''' is a [[Old|47-year old]] [[Scotland|Scot]] [[Tranny|'woman']] that was beaten with the [[ugly]] tree every year on her birthday. She recently appeared on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'', and surprised everyone by being kinda good. From there, fucking billions of people on [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[YouTube]] and basically every other [[website]] on the internets went crazy and made her into a fucking [[meme|God]], for singing one shitty song from some [[French]] play. E-mails were over-run by everyfuckingbody sending the same YouTube video. Susan's YouTube video went on to gain over [[over nine thousand|100 million]] views, [[irony|mostly from amerifags (most Britfags don't give a shit about her despite of being in the opinion that you don't need good looks to be successful]]).

It is without a doubt this explosive response to average opera singing would have never happened if Boyle wasn't abnormally hideous. Apparently [[fact|being ugly makes you less likely to have any talent]], and ''that'' is what's important here - giving millions of other [[you|shut-in virgins]] around the world a [[lie|flicker of hope]].

In what can only be described as taking [[rule 34]] too far, Boyle also has been [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2009/04/20/2009-04-20_british_singing_sensation_susan_boyle_to_star_in_.html asked to star] in a [[Bestiality|porno]], offering a possible new candidate for [[The Power 5]].

==/[[b]]/'s response==

Susan's attempts to be the female [[Rick Astley]] did not go unnoticed by /b/, who promptly dug up [[docs]]. However, [[moralfags]] quickly flooded the threads with protests that trolling Susan would be a reprehensible, unprovoked attack. Some more observant /b/tards pointed out the fact that, in attacking a 48 year old ugly [[virgin]] who lives with their mother, Anonymous would be, in theory, attacking themselves. Thus creating a paradox and [[dividing by zero]].

==Her loss==
Ultimatly on the big night of the Britain's Got Talent final, despite having so much media publicity that would put previous hopeful winners to shame and being part of the final few, she did not win this year's show. Instead, the British public had decided to [[troll]] the media and Miss Boyle's rabid fanbase by voting for [[Nigras|Diversity]] as the winning act instead. 


Infuriated by this turn of events, [[Faggots|Susan Boyle fans]] immediately got [[butthurt]] and a mass of [[Waaaambulance|Waaaambulances]] had to be called out to their homes. They started posting on their Facebook, Myspace and YouTube pages about how unfair it was that the public did not choose to vote for the one person that was being jammed down their throats 24/7. Some even went into [[denial]] about the event after sobbing into their tear-soaked pillows and [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|claimed Boyle had won anyway]]. To be fair nobody knows shit about Diversity now, which brings up the question... who's the true [[Winrar|winner]]?


The dumb bitch wanted to go and sing "A Perfect Day" by Loooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuu Reed. little did that fat cunt know, that the almighty Lou dosn't allow fat nasty cuntrags to sing his songs......Lou Reed:âˆž  fat ugly horse:0


{{quote|Susan has to be the winner unless a bias is evident on the final result..|Some butthurt faggot who nobody cares about}}

{{quote|The result is flawed or biased. The voting did not come from Internet and Britishes were prejudiced against her.|[[Facepalm|Yeah, how DARE the British public get to choose the winner of ''Britain's'' Got Talent.]]}}
