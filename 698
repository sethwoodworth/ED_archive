[[Image:Congress.jpg|thumb|right| Austin is the capitol of [[Texas]], home to the [[Fag Enabler | University of Texas]] - the [[Unwarranted self importance | largest]] public university in [[The Jewnited States of Americunts | 'Merica]]. Austin is also noted for it's burgeoning [[Emos | live music]] scene, hippies, and the occasional mass murderer.]]

'''Austin''' is the [[Hippy | hippie]] leftist cancerous growth on the otherwise [[redneck]] ballsack that is [[Texas]] and is the home to the University of Texas, stomping grounds of such e-notables as [[33mhz]], Molobolo, cupid Jungian and [[hardvice]], as well as several decent [[LJer]]s outside [[Dramacrat|Dramacratic]] circles. 

While perhaps not as central to [[teh]] [[drama]] as, say, [[Seattle]] or [[Atlanta]], it's worth noting that, as the former home of [http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/charles_whitman.html Charles Whitman], Austin is the birthplace of the [[School Shooting]], and thus has plenty of drama cred in its own right.

Austin is famous as the "weird little brother" of the rest of the State of Texas.  The "Keep Austin Weird" campaign epitomizes the large number of counter cultural forces that serve to regularly embarrass and frighten visiting state legislators from stolid, sensible, God-fearing places like [http://www.texasnaacp.org/jasper.htm Jasper] and [http://www.rickross.com/groups/waco.html Waco].

In 1966, [[Cho Seung Hui]] time-traveled back to the University of Texas Tower, this time equipped with a hunting rifle, and a white man mask. Going under the guise of "Charles Whitman", He proceeded to shoot [[at least 100]] students, before being taken down by two police officers. This was considered a failure, because he did not become [[an hero]].

== Attractions ==

'''Town Lake:''' Now renamed for Lady Byrd Johnson, "Town Lake" was originally named for itself, which was created by damming up the Colorado river and turning it into the biggest recreational place you've [[evar]] seen. Miles and miles of trails, bike routes, and bat watching places. If you stand at the end of South Congress at sunset, you'll be bombarded with bat shit. It used to be full of weed that all the old [[hippies]] grew, but they put some fish in and took care of the problem. Drinking the water in Town Lake is the 6th biggest cause of [[AIDS]] within the continental United States. Also used to be a great place to hold an Aqua Festival, but the local spics and artfags living along the lakes' many condo and barrio communities bitched and complained about the loud motors and all the people blocking their streets by parking their cars there, so the festival was dropped in the mid 1990s.

'''Barton Springs:''' A festering unchlorinated slime pit where you will catch hepatitis.

'''The Capitol:''' It's granite and has a huge underground parking lot-basement where it is rumored that A-rabs congregate.

'''The Mothership:''' The huge-fucking Whole Foods store that all others call "mother". It has it's own underground parking garage, food court, and herd of [[Indie]]-kids and [[Drug|artists]] who live there, begging for scraps from the food court. As it is located right down the street from the Austin branch of the Church of Scientology, many believe the store was originally a UFO that appeared when Tom Cruise last visited the city.

'''6th Street:''' Famous for its year round 24/7 gothfag music and clubs given battering ram enemas by the cops. Get a tattoo and a giant cock in your asshole all at once! That's savings!

'''The Warehouse District:''' Kind of like 6th Street, only with more [[AIDS]]

'''Downtown:''' Be prepared for endless art stores, retarded museums, and wannabe-hip coffee rings. Oh, and lots of transients, bums and junkies looking for handouts. Bring a club or a gun.

'''Lake [[No More Heroes|Travis]]:''' Yeah [[motherfucker]]!

'''Leslie Cochran:''' A homeless tranny who received twenty percent of the vote in a recent mayoral election. He has a makeshift home on the sidewalk and is [[W|AWOL]] mentally.

'''[[Hippie]] Hollow:''' Where [[lemonparty|old naked men]] go when they're not on the [[internets]]. Most women who skinny-dip here not only don't *skinny* anything, but you usually can't see either their boobs or their labia through all the pubic hair.

'''Mopac''' YOU ALWAYS FUCKING TAKE MOPAC WHEN YOU'RE IN AUSTIN, UNDERSTAND!?
-are you fucking stupid? or do you just like gridlock?

==Unattractions [[Suckage| So no reason for it to be here]]==
'''The University of Texas:''' The only school of Electrical Engineering in the world run by a [[wigger]], the infamous Dr. John D. Cogdell, nobody gives a shit about your stupid little engineering class smoke less dope and you'd pass it easier you fucking emokid. Produces more rapist-fratboys than [[Harvard]] and Yale combined. Also has a football team full of [[niggers]], but what college these days doesn't? Home of the original [[Cho]], Charles Whitman.

'''Anderson High School:''' The retarded stepchild of AIDS;  Used to be the black person school back during the days of [[lulz|segregation]]. As such, they haven't remodeled (or even cleaned) the building since. The old hag running the joint has taken her sad, pitiful life into consideration and after realizing she will never hold any position higher than the principal of the poorest of the rich schools, decided to turn it into a full-scale prison, complete with cameras and police officers (see: rent-a-cops) every 10 feet. If you value your sanity, don't go here.  Ever.  

'''Johnston High School:''' The high school with the worst academic record in Texas history, where most students are on the seven-year plan to graduation by age 21. They keep threatening to close it down, but none of the other schools would allow all the ghetto thugs and wetback rapists in their doors. Johnston exists not as a school, but as a temporary holding facility for tomorrow's human shit.

'''SH 130:''' An unwanted, unnecessary tollroad administered by towelheaded Arabs and corrupt politicians. Polls showed [[Ass_Rape|97.4% of those living in Travis and Williamson counties didn't want the roads, much less pay again to use them after their taxes were already supposed to be providing those same roads.]] [[White|TXDoT]] refused to listen, saying their bastard kids all needed new shoes.

'''SH 45:''' See above. Same shit, different road.

'''Round Rock, Georgetown & Williamson County:''' Next-door neighbors to Austin in the north. Home to [[Dell]] Computer Corporation and the most corrupt police departments west of the Mississippi. The Williamson Co. Gestapo has been under federal investigation for civil rights abuses against white folks for over twenty years, most of the cases involving teens and college punks getting busted for weed and booze, and then getting beaten and almost-raped in the lockups. Some 75% of all cases tried in the county go against the defendant, usually thanks to evidence and testimony falsified by the cops, or by the judge refusing to accept evidence that will acquit. Fines and judgments against those dumb enough to get busted in this county are 500% to 2,500% higher than any other area in the Western Hemisphere, which means that the Gestapo and their Judge bosses are amongst the highest paid public officials in the country. Avoid this county at all costs, especially if [[Satan|Dell]] has just hired you for tech support.

'''East Austin:''' There are tribes in [[Africa|East Austin]] that have never seen a white man. This is where most of Austin's black person live. Chock full of thugs, muggers, rapists, thieves, street walkers, and drug dealers. Oh, and of course, crack ho's. Austin is attempting to [[Ban_fucking_everyone|"revitalize"]] the area, starting with the section closest to Downtown, but has yet to answer the important question: where are all the niggers going to go when the trendy shops and condo dwellers drive them out? Certainly not next door to you!

'''Montopolis:''' This is where most of the [[Wetback|Mexican Americans]] dwell. The closest thing that Texas has to a barrio outside and north of [[San Antonio]]. No attempts are being made to revitalize the area, as the Mexicans are content to live in the squalor they've created. Note that there are approximately 3.15 taco and/or tamale stands per block in this area of town.

'''Westlake:''' The uber-rich part of Austin. They claim they're a separate town from Austin, but nobody outside of the enclave believes that. It is legal to shoot non-whites in Westlake, and anyone who doesn't live in Westlake is considered non-white. Only thing the area produces of note are sorority bimbos (all of whom usually end up with black person thug boyfriends) and [[wigger]] babies.

'''IH-35:''' The stretch that runs through Austin is the fourth most congested stretch of highway in the nation, mostly because TXDoT refuses to wipe it out and replace it with the 8-lane highway that the city needs running from one end to the other. Completely owns any school shooter by killing over 60 people a year.

'''North Lamar/Braker:''' This area used to be mildly affluent, but in recent years it's become home to thousands of fucking [[Starcraft|South Korean]] refugees. All of them are either employed by Samsung - which has a fab plant in Austin just up the road - or are related to someone employed there. But considering that all of fucking Korea has been a shithole since the days when M*A*S*H wasn't a work of fiction, who can blame them for wanting to [[Zerg Rush|get the fuck out]]? But then again, they should have gone somewhere where they'd be more at home, like San Fagcisco or Mexico City.

'''Stony Point High School:''' Would probably be a much, much better school if it weren't for all the black person and [[spics|mexicans]] (though the same could be said about [[America|pretty much anything]]).  The building itself is so pretty (it's only about [[pedophilia|10 years old]]), but it's been slowly destroyed and defaced by all the poverty-stricken minorities that don't know how to have nice things without carving gang signs and penises into them.  There's also a 9th Grade Center that basically serves as a petri dish for [[scene|retardedness]] and [[emo|general fuckery]].  Left alone, without the threat of being kicked in the dick by upperclassmen for being [[fags|idiots]], these 9th graders bloom into flowers of [[Hot Topic|unyielding stupidity]] that are then unleashed upon the main campus.  There's also a shit-ton of drugs being taken and sold at both the main campus and 9th grade campus, which has been covered multiple times on the local news.  Also, Mr. Thompson has [[queer|both nipples pierced]] and do not ask how I know this.

'''Westwood high school:''' Dwelling of rich kids in BMW's. Steal them. At least 100% of students are stoners. Senior principal is a pedophile.

'''Crockett High School:''' Really crappy school. Full of wanna-be [[nigra|gangstas]] and [[Mexicans]]. Currently run by some Jew principal from New York.

== The People ==
The residents of Austin fall into these categories:

* [[Hippies | Old Hippies]] / [[Yuppie | Techno-Hippies]] / [[Raver | Raver Hippies]] / [[Homeless | Crusty Hippies]].
* [[Hipsters]] can be spotted in Hyde Park and in the "rejuvenated" parts of [[Ghetto | East Austin]].
* [[Frat | College students]] can be seen stuffed into Cap Metro buses, [[Bukkake | guzzling]] [[Java | coffee]] at Starbucks while pretending to study (really: [[YouPorn]]), and holding up the line at [[7-11]] with their frequent [[Poverty | Pabst and Maruchan]] purchases.
* Although [[Homosexuality | The Gays]] keep their [[Perez Hilton | glory-holing]] restricted to West 4th St. they can be [[Fisted | spotted]] all over Austin.
* [[Stoners]] are everywhere in Austin.
* [[Spics | Spanish Americans]] (including, but not limited to: Cholos, Beaners, Wetbacks, Lawn Artists, Miggers, Paisas, Chili Chokers, and Border Bandits)
* [[Niggers | Antique Farm Equipment]]
* [[Azns | Viet-Cong]]

== Culture ==
Austin's culture is such that any successful attempt to create culture is quickly reverted. The void is then momentarily filled by whatever shit bands the city council can lure to the area within three months of cannibalizing their own people. After successfully destroying the [http://www.austinmusicnetwork.org Austin Music Network], the city council plans to constrict any live music venues into oblivion with pointless and heavy-handed laws. This will ultimately allow South By Southwest to impose itself upon the city with no competition.

Another example of how the City Council loves to fuck with any attempts to keep cultural diversity alive was the 2005 Smoking Ban. Although this was supposed to keep those patrons of bars and restaurants protected from the mythical dangers of second-hand smoke, it actually targeted dance halls, nightclubs and titty-bars. During the appeal to the courts to have the ban overturned, it was revealed that the ban was passed into law by a public vote consisting only of old people who were either too old and infirm to party like the youngsters, or just didn't like other people to have any fun regardless of age. The end result was most businesses in Austin seeing huge downturns in their income, as the non-smokers have not turned out in droves to replace the smokers that got chased off by the ban. Way to go, dipshits! Even if the ban is overturned somewhere down he road, the damage has already been done. Austin has only a handful of "Keep Austin Weird" bumper stickers left to identify itself from any other mundane college town.

The greatest irony in all this is the unnecessary bans, unwanted tollroads and hundreds of condos are being made to accommodate people moving to Austin, and simultaneously destroying the reason why people wanted to move there in the first place.

As the live music capitol of the world, Austin draws a lot of hipsters, emos, hippies, goths, and every subculture imagined.  When one moves to Austin for whatever purpose, they are automatically issued the entire Radiohead discography (minus Pablo Honey, as we all know that this album was destroyed in the lollercaust).

She [http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/18/ivins.richards/index.html?iref=newssearch died] in 2006 of a [[Rage | rage]] stroke, probably pissed off at something her [[W | successor]] did.

It prefers to be called [[Lie | a man]], hangs around 6th & Congress during the day, and if you ask nicely, it'll even come to [[Circle jerk | your house party]].

== Events ==
[[Image:Eeyoresbirthday.JPG | thumb | "...and then the solo is all like WHAA NAAAAAAAA NA NYAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!... oh man I got the munchies..."]]

=== South by Southwest ===
(moar liek South by Sofuckingwhat, amirite?) If the hipster-coddling [[Redundant | Jew-financed]] indie rock scene were a religion then SXSW would be their [[Terrorism | Mecca]]. Austinites spend each and every March surrounded by the same [[Yuppies]] which you may find to be refreshingly absent from your city. Remember when people cared about the Sundance Film Festival? And the way people from Utah would bitch and moan over the influx of douchey scenesters into their quiet little communities? No? Well, I bet you saw the ''Southpark'' episode about it, and SXSW is essentially the same thing, but for fag-rock. In an effort to swindle further [[Jew gold]] from the nation's trust fund jockeys, the event's organizers have recently incorporated a film festival, and now an "Interactive Festival", drawing the total running length of the event to just over 52 weeks per year. You can always tell when SXSW is going on because your AT&T service slows down to a goddamn crawl - that would be the additional 15,000 [[IPhone | iPhones]] kicking around town.

=== Eeyore's Birthday Party ===
Every April the city's [[Hippy | hippie]] population scampers out from under their cardboard boxes long enough to take over the aptly named Pease Park in celebration of a [[Lies | fictional]] cartoon character's birthday. This celebration comes in the form of [[Faggotry | freestyle frolicking]], sharing poorly rolled joints and reeking of armpit sweat. Participants are encouraged to dress in gaudy costumes or just plain old hippie uniforms, parade their hairy scrotums and sagging teats in the presence of children, and basically act like complete and utter [[Fag | faggots]].

=== Austin Reggae Festival ===
Why go to [[Jamaica]] when Jamaica can come to you? That's the line of reasoning behind [http://www.austinreggaefest.com/ "Bob Marley Fest"]. Fun fact: it's no longer officially called Bob Marley Fest because even Marley's family want nothing to do with a bunch of scraggly white hippies from Texas. As with the aforementioned Eeyore's Birthday, Marley Fest is just another excuse for crusty [[Wook | wooks]] to smoke pot outside, instead of in their more traditional locales - mom's basement, or in the alley behind ITT Tech between classes.

=== Texas Relays ===
You can never truly appreciate the abject shittiness of [[niggers]] until they've swarmed your home town like a mush-mouth plague of chrome rims and boxer waistbands. Texas Relays started out as a no shit track & field competition, but the athletic events have become overshadowed by the accompanying street ape party scene that infests Austin each spring. Great place to see gleaming 20-inch rims supporting primer-grey 1989 Civics, gang bangers crowding out your neighborhood gas station, and a good ol' fashioned shivving or two. Local business owners now face [[Thats racist | allegations of racism]] should they decide to cut business hours during this weekend. Highland Mall owners, who - due to the fact that they own Highland Mall - could not afford the extra security to keep thieves out and had to shorten their ours last year. They instantly became the most high profile "racists" in town. In the words of local civil rights leader Toby Boy, "Dibbersity be are stremf." Makes you wistful for the days of slavery. 

=== ACL Fest ===
What SXSW has in money and notoriety, Austin City Limits has in actual music. Granted, there are more than enough [[shit]] bands performing each year, but the ratio of Flogging-Mollys-to-Franz-Ferdinands is much better than people like to give credit. ACL is only a few big time acts away from competing with Coachella or Lollapalooza, but, because it's held in the summer in Texas, and because nothing good escapes the ever-fuckling grasp of the city council, ACL will probably stay where it is forever.

== Trolling Austinintes ==
