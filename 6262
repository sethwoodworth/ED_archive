'''Paranoid personality disorder''' (PPD), is a form of [[crazy|craziness]] more commonly known as ''[[$cientology]]'' Disease. Sufferers are suspicious of everyone and believe that [[You|evil green space villains]] are trying to [[conspiracy|steal their souls]]. They also often believe that the Government is under control of these aliens and they are the only [[unwarranted self importance|enlightened]] beings who can see this. PPD is often mistaken for [[schizophrenia]] but the difference is that schizos hallucinate and believe they can see the monsters, PPD suffers pretend to see them in order to fit in with the Scientology community. Due to the enormous prevalence of [[mental illness]] in this cult it is necessary to hide this fact through the technique of accusing everyone as heretics.

== Symptoms ==

* Desire to spend money for a [[Religion|religious cause]] or anyone promising happiness.
* The dangerous desire to further the space faggotry and beliefs of [[Scientology]]. 
* Accuses all [[psychologist]]s and [[psychiatrist]]s of being the most evil of [[Xenu]] worshippers.
* Embracing the idea of tin foil hats as their sole clothing choice.
* Offers free personality tests to anyone willing to waste their time.

== Treatment ==

The treatment for PPD is extensive psychotherapy and medication, but as the [[Co$]] forbids these things there is little to no chance of ever being cured. [[Project Chanology]] is a popular alternative and has thus far proved a [[portal|huge success]]. Another treatment recommended by normal people is to make the patient [[poor]] by creating a new religion, but further research has not been provided.
