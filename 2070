Datura
{{pixpls}}

'''Datura''' (also known as Jimsonweed) is an anticholinergic [[drug]]; it's basically like [[peyote]] except that it grows everywhere and gives you a bad trip 99% of the time. It is usually used by retarded ranchers and dirt-poor white trash who can't afford meth, or stupid hippie hikers. 9 times out of 10 you will end up OD'ing on it and end up running naked from the [[cops]] screaming about how ''YOU TOTALLY SAW GOD AND IT LIKE BLEW YOUR MIND MAN''! Or at least that's what people told you you did when you come to 3 days later in a [[mexico|mexican]] prison.

==Belladonna'' (Deadly nightshade)==
Belladonna is another anticholinergic drug related to jimsonweed. Glory unto [[White]] [[Jesus]]! Turns out, [[Lie|any plant which will kill you in large doses gets you high in slightly-less-large doses]]. Who'd a thunk it? '''''Belladonna''''', also known as <u>deadly nightshade</u>, contains a potent anticholinergic deliriant which is imbued with the same wonderful [[magick]]s as jimsonweed. If you can manage to get the right dosage, rather than [[dying]] a horrible death, you will be rewarded with a horrible trip full of spiders and death secks from your favorite childhood toys.
