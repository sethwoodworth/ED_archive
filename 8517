Transhumanism

Transhumanism is a completely retarded movement that consist of [[Star Trek]] nerds, comic book geeks and other assorted losers who think that with the advances of technology, they will eventually be able to edit their hideous bodies into examples of chiseled good looks.  They view their human appearance as disgusting and ugly, and wish to make everyone into beautiful, shiny robots or genetic ubermensch so nobody will be able to call them "zitface" or "fatty" ever again.  It's a movement that is completely rooted in fiction, whos tenets and beliefs are all cropped from the followers favorite Science Fiction stories, kind of like how Pagans take elements from their favorite fantasy stories and incorporate them into their beliefs.  That being said, there's a ridiculously equal amount of retarded detractors who make it their life mission to fight against this "movement" because the idea of these geeks one day gaining superpowers and controlling the world just makes them shit their pants.  All of their arguments are literally titled from which fictional story they think best represents "anti-transhumanism", such as crappy films like Gattaca, and in the process, fail just as hard as transhumanist.

Despite the fact that every single inspiration from any side of this movement comes from fiction, transhumanist claim their beliefs are rooted in [[lie|hard science]] and that they have real scientist and engineers that back them up.  Like [[Ray Kurzweil]], a completely batshit insane [[retard|futurist]] who thinks human beings will be able to transform themselves into robotic bugs and fly around the universe in tiny shapeships, and that he is preventing humankinds extinction from the hands of machines by inserting a chip in his hand that acts as a mouse for his computer.  With people like that backing up your ideas, who needs detractors!

== Transhuman sexuality ==

It is also a well-known fact that many transhumanists have a [[Mechanophilia|hard-on for machines]], and enjoy masturbating to [[Transformers]] porn. Humans, being so inferior, can no longer sexually arouse them. Only the cold hard steel of a robot cock can make them cum.

== Designer babies ==

Then there is the designer baby.  A designer baby is, what transhumanist claim, a genetically engineered, cybernetic, super intelligent human that will be the wave of the future.  Apparently, the idea of turning people into simple technological commodities doesn't worry the transhumanist the least bit.  To them, it's just one more step to that techno-paradise they've read about in all those books they love so much! They think there should be no limits to genetic engineering, because if it is advanced technology, nothing can go wrong!  Human beings becoming technological commodities whos traits and skills going up for sale on the private market is not a problem whatsoever, it seems.  At best, transhumanist are completely dense nerds who want to make some utopia from their fantasies, at worst, their retarded policies, if implemented, would lead to exploitation and discrimination.  

Viva la technology!

On the other hand, the use of genetic engineering would prevent black person [[You|horrible]] [[Retard|conditions]]. 
And, after all, as long as you aren't a complete loser, discrimination based on income isn't so bad.
