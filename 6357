Personal space
'''Personal Space''' comes in 2 forms, and like most things, those are [[IRL]] and [[OL]].

==IRL Personal Space==

IRL Personal space is the area around me that [[Your|your]] fat ass occupies when Im trying to catch a fucking train to work. It is also how close [[you]] can get to a women before she either: 

* Screams
* Uses Mace
* Claims shes being [[Almost Raped]]
* Passes out from your black person [[Eproctophilia|odour]].

IRL Personal Space is [[srs bsns]]. Intruding into another persons personal space can make them feel [[Goatse|un-comfortable]] and agitated. Therefore, for the savvy IRL [[Rapist|troll]], intruding into someones personal space is a fantastic technique. Entering into someone elses personal space will usually get them to look at you, which in [[You|your]] case, is quite enough to troll someone into insanity.

==OL Personal Space==

A Personal Space on the [[Internet]] could include a profile on social networking sites such as [[Myspace]], [[Failbook|Facebook]], [[Livejournal]], [[Vampire Freaks]] and more. However, owing to the fact that people are always more hardcore, than the porno hidden in your Dad's underwear drawer, on the Tubes, defense of OL Personal Space can lead to some hilarious results.

One way of intruding someone OL personal space is to simply add them as a friend and then procede to [[flame]] the shit out of them. Another, more savvy way, is to phish their account information and passwords. A method made famous by the [[Gov.palin@yahoo.com]] incident. 

[[Chris-Chan]] is one example of someone stupid enough to have both their OL and IRL personal space intruded, and for some reason, keep coming back for more.
