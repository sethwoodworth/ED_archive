'''Beeripedia''' was a shitty [[wiki]] about [[beer]]. It was known for being particularly [[crap]] because unlike people who [[party hard]] and drink [[metrosexual|designer beer]] like Corona with lime and pay ridiculous prices in trendy bars for it, the people who ran this wiki were [[old|old men]] with nothing better to do than sample all the various ales that the world has. Their [[sysop]]s were believed to be [[redneck]] [[Americunts]] living in the Deep South, although most of their contributors were [[Britfag]] old men who have the same feelings. I mean, does anyone really give a fuck about the Campaign for Real Ale?

==About Beeripedia==
Beeripedia was formed in [[2006]] as a response to the lack of a wiki about beer, obviously. However, the site's creators decided that it would be an awesome idea to put in an extra "i". What's with that, anyway? [[Boobpedia]] is not "Boobipedia", is it? Anyway, "Titties and Beer" is a good combination. It's a Frank Zappa song.

Beeripedia was a great and extremely [[exploitable]] place for page move vandalism, like [[Willy on Wheels]], or more obviously, [[Grawp]]. Unlike [[Wikipedia]], moving pages on Beeripedia did not give you an adrenaline rush to see how much you could move before getting blocked (the adrenaline [[rush]] from moving pages on Wikipedia has been [[fact|scientifically proven]] to be greater than that of skydiving and jumping off cliffs and becoming [[an hero]]). In fact, like many lesser-known wikis, you could do a lot of damage in a short space of time. It was preferable to do this whilst out of your mind on [[drugs]], so that whilst you felt no [[butthurt|pain]] because you're barely aware of what you're doing, the sysops had one beer and are about to have another but wouldn't do so until they've cleaned up all the [[vandalism]].
