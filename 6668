'''Psychopaths''' (''also known as [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopaths]]'') are people like [[bitch|you]] and [[troll|me]]. They feel [[confusion|misunderstood]] and maligned by society because, in contrast to their reputation for [[murder|atrocity]], they have done a lot of really good things. Among their accomplishments are taking up the task of [[W|bringing peace to the Middle East]], [[Osama bin Laden|championing faith in God]], and [[Adolf Hitler|removing the undesirable elements from society]]. The diligent reader should take care not to confuse [[Teenager|teenagers]] with psychopaths. Teens are responsible for a plurality of [[drunk|automobile accidents]], [[angst]], and [[:Category:Music|lame music]]. 

According to online psychometric surveys, readers and users of Encyclopedia Dramatica are wildly more psychopathic (and/or autistically gifted) than the general population, which doesn't understand our [[gifts|special talents]] and insights into the human condition. Recently, Encyclopedia Dramatica has been a subject of controversy due to mainstream (i.e. bribed) psychiatrists pointing out its nature as a networking and breeding ground for psychopathic personalities. 

==Sociopaths and the Internet==

{{quote|I would like to say though, Sully, if this helps at all, that I think the people who make the best trolls or do just generally troll shit are the same people who either got bullied at school or just ignored everyone at school.|-Some loser on the PVCC forums(AKA The Chris Chan trolling hub)}}

Most trolls consider themselves sociopaths. They think all those years being bullied and ignored at school have hardened their soul. The years spent in their bedrooms with no social contact have turned them into [[loser|cold hearted nihilists]], no longer capable of feeling emotional pain. Only they understand real pain, and it is therefore them and ''only'' them that can really hurt people. As a defense mechanism, they malign the whole of the human race. Bitter and introverted, they find hope on Encyclopedia Dramatica.[http://forums.encyclopediadramatica.com/showthread.php?t=826&highlight=sociopath A Typical ED forum topic.]  

Ironically, the misanthropic troll always jumps at the opportunity to talk about himself. A topic like 'do you have sociopathic tendencies' is always guaranteed to net pages and pages of replies on the ED forums. This is why you as an encyclopedia dramatica user will need the following guide.

[[Trolling the trolls]]:

- Suggest that the reality is that everyone hates them, and not the other way around.   

- Suggest that it was their fault that they were bullied at school. Point out that most kids that are bullied tend to be [[arrogant|cocks]] anyway. 

- Say you don't like the works of Chuck Palahniuk or Charles Bukowski.

- Tell them their cynical insights into the human psyche are pathetic.

- Point out that ironically, it is them who cannot take criticism. Otherwise why would they be riling internet users rather than immersing themselves in life itself and dealing with all the pain and setbacks it entails.


==Identifying Our Psycho Friends==
Psychopaths possess numerous personality traits that set them apart from everyone else.

* Characteristic '''open honesty''' about themselves and their past.
* '''Kindly willingness to help out'''. They're so nice and helpful, so next time one of them asks you for help, please return the favor.
* '''High achievement'''. You will be amazed that someone who has accomplished so much is willing to talk to little ole [[you]].
* Psychopaths possess the remarkable talent of being able to [[James Bond|'''keep cool''' in the fiercest of situations.]]
* '''Bold vision.''' Psychopaths are ready to think outside the box, no matter how radical their ideas may seem to others.
* '''Fun loving'''. Join one on an outing; you'll be sure to have an unforgettable time!
* Many psychopaths have high [[USI|'''leadership potential'''.]] Whether it is their way of words or their friendly demeanor, they attract groupies like flies to honey(& shit).

==Psychopathy's Bad Reputation==
Unfortunately, some in the psychiatric and criminological professions have termed the valuable personality traits of psychopathy a [[mental illness|personality disorder]] because they're jealous. The [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] [[DSM|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] calls it [[antisocial personality disorder]], and the [[United Nations]] World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases calls it [[dissocial personality disorder]]. All the diagnostic criteria for these personality disorders are false and misleading.

In many cases, the diagnostic signs of so-called psychopathic personality ''disorder'' are the exact opposite of how psychopaths truly are. <- ([[What|wut]]) Again, the [[old people|crusty old experts]] are just jealous that they can't mack beautiful women all day too.

==The Psycho in a Relationship==
Occasionally a [[woman]] finds herself in a relationship with a psychopath; in this case, she is incredibly lucky. Sadly, these women are often not ready for a [[real man]] and become doubly aware of their personal [[Inadequacy|inadequacies]] when attempting to love a psychopath. This woman, when facing the harsh reality of herself, may break down and blame all her shortcomings on her [[significant other]].

When the psychopath finally breaks off his relationship with his "lover," he can breathe a sigh of relief and continue to live his life independently. Being the endlessly giving and forgiving people that they are, psychopaths too often end up with callous, controlling mates.

Of course, never thinking of himself, the psychopath may try to help his former lover by initiating contact again. ''Can she make it without me?'', ''Is she safe?'', ''Is she heart broken that I left her?'' are the thoughts that dominate a psychopath's mind after he ends a [[love|romantic]] relationship. Thus worried, the psychopath may then call her to check up on her every so often or [[Stalk|follow]] her to work and home to make sure she's doing all right. He may even [[Rape|offer her a second chance]].

==The Psycho at the Helm==
[[Image:Psycho kid.gif|thumb|<s>Psycho Kid</s> Niggers can't be psychopaths]]
Sometimes psychopaths are chosen to lead a team, corporation, or even a whole country. Since psychopaths are bold visionaries and superb leaders, change will rapidly follow their ascent. Some sticklers will always be more concerned about details like procedure and caution, and these people just get in the way when a psychopath is about to revolutionize things! As with relationships, the subordinates to a psychopathic leader may sense their personal inadequacies for the first time. They may spread rumors about the psychopath's taking [[Sadism|sadistic]] pleasure in firing the obstinate employees and forcing busywork on others. They are merely projecting what they would do if they were in charge onto the kindly psychopath. They can see neither the [[Time Cube|big picture]] nor the [[subliminal messages]].

==The Psycho Child at Risk==
Psychopaths don't just come out of no where. Psychopaths were first children. The shocking truth is children showing promise as psychopaths are at an increased risk for delinquency of all kinds. At school, the superior intelligence of the psychopathic child is easily bored because the teacher focuses his or her efforts on mere mortals. This child may act up, earning him nothing but [[punishment]]. Of course, the child is still bored with the useless facts school offers him, so he continues to act up. He may torture the class pet or the teacher's pet, tell jokes while the teacher is droning on about something, or pick on some stupid kid who's actually paying attention to the lesson. The psychiatric profession may intervene at this point and slap one of their fancy labels like [[ADD|attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], oppositional-defiant disorder, or conduct disorder on the poor boy.

At home the child who shows promise as a psychopath may be punished needlessly for things that aren't even his fault. His father may beat him mercilessly; and his mother, who's probably too busy [[Sex|fucking]] somebody else's dad, doesn't even notice. Sometimes a psychopath is lucky enough to have a good family; this makes his behavior all the more surprising because some experts believe psychopathy is the result of triumph over adversity.

==Trolling Sociopaths==
You want to [[troll]] [[Suicide|WHAT]]?<BR><BR>
'''Procedure'''<BR>
#Go to a forum with sociopathic members.
#Insult and mock the psychos for all [[nothing|you're worth]].
#???
#PROFIT!
Luckily for you, sociopaths can't be trolled, since they just don't care enough. If you're lucky, you might attract ones attention and be [[Stalker|stalked]] by them for a while, but that's the best you're gonna manage. There are a couple of [[forum]]s that exist for sociopaths, each with about three actual sociopaths and 200+ [[n00b|nubs]]. On [http://www.psychforums.com/ PsychForums], (scroll down to the "[[Antisocial personality disorder]]" subforum), you can find open and frank discussions of [[cake|cannibal]]ism, while on [http://www.sociopathic.net sociopathic.net] there is a more general range of discussions. Remember, if you get an irl sociopath really pissed with you, you win the [[internets]].

==Sociopaths IRL==
[[irl]], anti-social personality disorder is characterized by black person, [[fag|trouble coping with societal norms]], or [[Republican|violating people's personal rights or lives]].

So basically, whatever the fuck people say it is.

And he was going to turn me in, but before he got the chance I went to the manager and pinned the whole thing on him. Kid lost his job, the cops got involved, I don’t know what happened to him. And I guess something like that is supposed to make me feel bad, right? It’s supposed to hurt, right? But instead, it’s like there’s nothing... Nothing.|Frank the psychopath}}
