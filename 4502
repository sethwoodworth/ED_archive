'''Kate's Party''' is a <s>PRIVATE PARTY</s> the quickest growing party on the [[Earth|planet]], with an RSVP number of well [[over 9000]]. It will take a [[Your Mom|large]] amount of [[Jenkem|food]] to feed all of the attendees, so it is encouraged that you bring a bag of chips along with you to the party. It is said that this shall be the largest house-party of all time because austria is for dick mongers. 

It will be held at Kate's [[basement|Apartment]], located on North Street in [[Adelaide]], [[Prison|Australia]]. Should Kate be caught up in [[serious business]], she has left instructions to start a block party without her.

Transportation is being arranged by [[God]] himself, as, this party shall be of [[Rapture|biblical]] proportions, so make sure you're attending by April 30th for travel arrangements.

{{tinyquote|How about '''Keep''', but if a person is found to have invited him or herself to the party and edited the WP article he or she should be banned from WP for ever for '''WP:COI'''?|Kitfoxxe}}

Kate's birthday party is already so legendary that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%27s_Birthday_Party a page] for this historic celebration has been created on [[TOW]], however, the [[wikipedos]] are such [[dicks|party poopers]] that they have tried to [[buzzkill|kill the buzz]] by baleeting said page. You can help by recreating it.

==Kate Responds==
[[File:Darth-vader-gas-mask.jpg|thumb|[[PROTIP]]: Dress code for Kate's Party]]
In an exclusive [[ED]] interview, Kate dropped science on the forthcoming historic Guinness Book of Records sized [[EPIC|EPIC PARTY]].

{{quote|Saturday night it was funny. It had a few hundred people and no one was really being nasty. Then by Sunday they had found out my street address and people had started stealing my photo. That is when it became scary. The 100s of creepy msgs mainly from [[ebaums|teenage boys]] was revolting and the 1000+ friend requests bothersome.|Kate}}

Furthermoar...potential partygoers may want to BYOGasmask. Or [[buy a dog]].

{{quote|We are now at the stage were [[moot|any teenage boy]] who walks down my street and looks at me more than twice is going to get pepper sprayed.|Kate}}

==Breaking News...==
[[File:Partys_closed.png|thumb|850px|center|[[DISREGARD THAT|FUCK THAT...]] SEE YOU ON MAY 1ST.]]

==Hoax Claims==

Despite Ausfalian [[attention whore]]/troll [[David Thorne]]'s claims in Ausfalian meeja that the whole '''Kate's Party''' phenomena is a [[unfunny|not very elaborate]] hoax, [[ED]]'s crack [[LNN|Lulz News]] team of [[1337]] [[google|investigative journalists]] has established that Kate is 100% real, that it is her birthday and that she is still having a party on Saturday May 1st in Adelaide. Mr. Thorne is nothing but a triflin [[cockblock|party pooper]] and [[hater]] due to the fact that he tried to get in Kate's knickers and was rebuffed. 

So, [[tl;dr|in short]], you should [[disregard]] David Thorne since he sucks cocks (after Kate spurned him he turned him gay) and [[PARTY HARD]] on North Street in Adelaide on Saturday. Bring all your friends, your own beer and [[fleshlight|party favours]] for Kate.
