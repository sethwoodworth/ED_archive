Steve the Super Villian
[[Image:Steve-the-supervillain.jpg|thumb|Steve]]
[[unfunny|Incredibly hilarious]] swf movie that details how a cartoon super villian uses Linux to "crush those who oppose us." Modeled after the popular [[apple switch ads]], it's ridiculously funny and super cool if you are a [[nerd]]. His voice is very affected and nasally sounding. If someone quotes Steve you might not know it so here are some choice phrases he uses:
*"We use linux to CRUSH those who oppose us!"
*"Patch yer kernel." with military-style salute
*"Gorgeous Femme Bots with a penchant for evil."
*"I've got a Beowulf cluster of atomic supermen."
*"My name's Steve... I'm a super villian."
