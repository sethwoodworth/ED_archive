Jenna Miscavige-Hill is a critic of the cult of Scientology (a.k.a. an SP, or "suppressive person," in the cult's moonspeak lingo) who fights the good fight against [[$cientology]]. Not only is she totally *fap* worthy but she is the niece of the current Chairman of the Board (''de facto'' leader of Scientology), [[David Miscavige]], a.k.a. The Angry Asthmatic Dwarf. Jenna Miscavige-Hill’s father is Ron Miscavige, the older brother of David Miscavige.

==Life as a $cientologist==

From the age of six to twelve she lived at a $cientologist compound where she indoctrinated and was forced to do chores like pick up and carry heavy rocks no matter what the weather. $cientologist are sick fucks who don't give a crap about child abuse. (Children are considered to be just smaller "meat bodies," so treating children any less shitty than an adult is "out-ethics" (i.e., wrong) for a Scientologist.) 

Jenna would only get to see her parent once a week because they kept working for the cult. The insane parents reasoned that without $cientology to save the galaxy from alien brainwashing, their kids don't have a future anyways.  She was exposed to a variety of brainwash techniques at the cult compound. She was forced to sign a contract saying that she would devote herself to $cientology for a billion years- not content with ordering up as lifetime of misery, Scientology expects its memebers to return for hundreds of millions of lifetimes. 

Her parents later decided to stop spoiling her rotten with monthly visits and sent her to Florida. The compound was closed by the government in 1999, presumably due to AIDS. From ages 12 to 16, Jenna saw her mom once and her dad only three times, which was probably three times too many.

==Life as an "SP"==

She is now actively discussing why $cientology is a harmful cult and a fraud. She has been interviewed several times by various television news agencies. One of her primary goals is exposing the truth behind Scientology’s denials that it puts pressure on members to break all contact with relatives who do not support the movement--a practice known as Disconnection. Jenna Hill says the Disconnection policy is what broke up her own family.
