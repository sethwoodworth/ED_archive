Adella
[[Image:Float-girl.gif|thumb|what]]
An insatiable [[drama whore]] who [[Deleting your LiveJournal|quit LJ forever]], '''Adella''' was unsatisfied with her dark tendrils existing only on [[LiveJournal|the cesspool of the internets]] and also spread her evil influence to ''[[World of Warcraft|World of Faggots]]''. Her fanboys were quite sad when she was [[dramouted]]. Adella is an incredibly opinionated, self-absorbed [[cosplay]]er. Don't dare have a different opinion than her, or she will force it down your throat and remark how incredibly wrong your input is.

Is it real? The whore would like us to think not, but why would anybody go through the trouble of photoshopping such a nobody? <strike>Maybe a bitter, life-less ex-boyfriend?</strike>. Probably Adella herself to fuel her selfish need for attention. Oh please. Ramian? Photoshop? Ramian can barely wipe his own ass.

==Early years==
Adella was first sighted [[at least 100 years ago]] in 2001 on [http://adella.livejournal.com/ her LiveJournal].  Most of the older entries are broken because she [[Deleting your LiveJournal|quit LJ forever]], but the short form of her story is that she was completely ignored as a painfully generic [[attention whore|internet female]] until she started cockteasing [[13 year old boys]] by doing [[cosplay]] as various characters in their masturbatory fantasies. When even [[LiveJournal]] proved too small for her attention appetite, she [[Deleting your LiveJournal|quit LJ forever]] and set up shop at an [http://www.adellacosplay.com independent website], where she continues to commit statutory rape and masturbate over the fact that prepubescent boys drool over her.

She also played ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' for a while in there, and has quit the game several times for various reasons. Now she claims not to respect anyone who plays despite the fact she herself used to be an avid player.

==LiveJournal/Website antics==
* Makes a point of detailing every wound she receives when putting together her costumes. Apparently she deserves pity for being an incompetent seamstress. Also tends to overplay the wounds themselves. For example, for a half-inch cut into her finger, she was playing thankful she didn't need stitches. Whatever happened to a novel thing called a Band-Aid, our expert team of researchers are still looking in to.
* Constantly revamps the way she can be contacted, all the while complaining about the strange messages and spam she gets, as though it's a surprise these people find her when she's plastering her name everywhere she can possibly manage.
* Posts fluff and filler whenever she has no new way to give little boys a woody, but needs her dose of attention for the day.  Most recently "WHY IS SALAD SO GOOD?!!?!"
* Known to use DeviantArt as a dump for most of her idiotic costumes, for even more [[attention whore]] power.

==World of Warcraft antics==
[[Image:dreadmistnerd.jpg|thumb|One of Adella's many sugar daddies, Nobunaga.]]
* Engaged in [[cybersex]] in return for prestige favors, like expensive mounts.
* Aggressively pursued using TeamSpeak with anyone she could manage, to spread her screeching, horrible, harpy-like voice to the ends of the earth.
* Cried like a 2-year-old at the first sign of any opposition and expected people to compensate for her temper tantrums
* Whored posts on the realm forums to bring as many uninterested people into her maelstrom of drama as she possibly could.
* Broke all ties and contact with her "best-friend" after a raiding incident in-game.
* Broke up with live-in boyfriend of 4 years for a guy she met in ''World of Warcraft''.
* Broke up with that boyfriend for another guy she met in ''World of Warcraft''.

==Real life antics==
* Obsessively [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] about her costumes.  Known to turn into an ice queen and unleash [[cock|THE MOTHERFUCKING FURY]] for commenting on a costume with "it's alright".
* Is also known for going on insulted rampages when she is confused with other Aeris cosplayers. Apparently she expects everyone to ignore their real life to keep tabs on her costumes so they know who she has and has not cosplayed and what conventions she has attended so they will not get her confused.
* A house leech. Relies on her cameraman for sustenance while she sits at home and sews her costumes.  No 'real' job to speak of. This also explains why she has so much time to postwhore.
* JESUS FUCKING CHRIST LOOK AT THAT NOSE. IT'S LIKE A PENIS WITH THESE TWO SKINNY LITTLE TESTICLES ON IT.
* Spends HOURS on end working on her pointless costumes when ANYONE could spend a fortune and waste their time trying to become and "third world star" like she thinks she is.
* Pays for ALL of her own gay-ass photo shoots. She'd break a digital camera, so she relies on her bribed camera-men and their expensive, professional cameras to get the pointless job done.
* She also has a lazy eye. Yes, I know, gross.

==About her fanbase==
[[Image:MarieAdella.jpg|thumb|Most selfish cosplayer in history portrays most selfish Austrian woman in history]]

What keeps this attention whore up is mostly the ass kissing compliments she feeds off of. Most of her [[Aimee|fans]] are either fat drooling pedophiles who fap every time she posts an image of her dirty pillows bobbing around or a mindless horny puberty-hitting child. Their comments about ED never scandalized us, instead, their grammar and pathetic insults ensued lots of lulz. Even some of them pretending to beat us virtually with a light saber (which proves nerds do exist on her site).

{{warning|text=Mindnumbingly idiotic fanboi-ism ahead}}

One look at the comments on her [[cosplay]] site will tell you straight off that this cyberslut doesn't exactly appeal to the highest grade of human being.  Otaku lingo, netspeak, and what are obviously the [[13 year old boys]] she takes behind the trailers on a regular basis postwhore as much as they can manage in an attempt to gain the eye of their avatar goddess of attention whoring.

A pretty good cross-section of the fanbase is below. It's worth noting that they found this article within a few hours of it being originally posted, and vandalized it soon after. Much [[lulz]] to be had.  [http://www.adellacosplay.com/entry/new-costume/P25/ Link to the source thread]:

I know, and all they’re showing by posting [[comment whore|our comment]]s is that Adella has more support and friends [[Special:Listusers|than they do]](not part of the comment: yeah, for fucks sake, an entire... 4 ppl has been posting! omigosh! thats a big fucking lot of friends) :3 so that does us some good!

Yeah.We’re the winners,and ED are the losers.They prove that they’re the losers,and that they’ll never win.It’s funny to see them dig themselves deeper and deeper into [[shit|doggy dung]].

They also are afraid of people editing their entries.I guess they’re afraid of people finding out the truth about Adella,so they become unglued and scramble to revert the entry to lies before anyone finds out the truth.

Exactly.. and they’re just jealous, anyway.. I bet they look like the rear-end of a donkey, and have no sewing/cosplay skills whatsoever, XD<br>

''Editor's note: This person [[clearly]] hasn't read this article, hence a great irony.''

== DeviantART ==
[[Image:Recentedreaction.png|thumb|ED = 100% If by "libel" we're speaking up her nude image she'd have to prove it isn't her, which she knows she can't [[libel]]]]

On deviantART her fandom of choice is ''[[Zelda]]'' rather than ''[[Final Fantasy 7|Final Fantasy]]''. This is likely due to the fact that more TARTletts that are ''Zelda'' fans get into the daily top favorites than those who bow and kiss the feet of the almighty [[emo|Cloud]]. One must wonder why she doesn't just leech off of the ''Kingdom Hearts'' fandom and ride the wave of popularity that would follow.

In 2004 Adella was fighting off allegations that her character looked like Aeris, a character she is constantly raping with her cosplay. Of course, [http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/10471858 she looks nothing like Aeris with her hair down].

She has begun commissions on deviantART, and actually expects to be paid for making poorly drawn pictures. This is the only known source of income she has earned herself, despite the fact she has only had about two commissions.

In response to a recent [[asspat|comment]] on her DA site regarding this article, Adella indicated that if she wasn't so busy she would pursue [[lawsuit|legal action]] against ED and its [[fact|"100% libel"]].
