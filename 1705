Community

On [[LiveJournal]], a '''community''' is a forum where multiple users have posting access so they can spread their brainfarts and mental wankage to even more idiots.

Much [[drama]] is created in communities, such as:

* Mod drama - created when the [[moderator]] tries to enforce their will on the community
* [[Ratings Communities]] - a weird community type where you have to prove your beauty/coolness/ability to eat Twinkies to get in
* Abuse drama - where [[LJ Abuse]] bans communities for violating the nebulous [[TOS]]
* Community deleting drama - where the mod packs up their community and goes home

In a more general sense, the word "community" is often used on the [[internets]] as shorthand for "ridiculous circle-jerk," e.g. "the [[DDR]] community," "the [[Buffy]] community," or "the Harry Potter motor-oil face-rape fic community."
