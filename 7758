Squee
'''Squee''' ''(usually written *squee*, squee! *squeeeage*, etc)'' is the shrill banshee call of the [[fangirl]]. In the most common situations, it may convey one of several things:

*The discovery of [[yaoi]]
*[[Bishounen]] (see above)
*Something along the lines of arousal
*[[Pocky]]
*The discovery of something "smexy," which can include [[yaoi]].
*Irrational Exuberance
*[[Sonic]] or some other anime faggot
*Cock too Big!

It's usually used in conjuction with one of the many forms of [[^_^]] and other histrionic spasms.  Offline, you can hear the echoes of "squee" throughout the crowds of [[anime]] conventions.  It's been likened to the sound of a cave overpopulated by rabid bats, or hungry [[Metroid]]s.

Squee is not only a sound effect and a bastardized emote, but is also a state of mind.  Words said and written by fangirls can re-create the same horrid screech in the mind of anyone within radius of their range of voice or even glancing through their typed word. Such symptoms of squee include nausea, headache, [[Mary Sue]] induced trauma, violent tendencies towards [[otaku]] and images of "^_^" flashing before your eyes.
