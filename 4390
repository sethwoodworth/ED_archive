'''John Travolta'''  (born Josef Goldstein) is a [[wanker|Hollywood]] [[cosplay|actor]] best known for playing the dad in the critically-acclaimed ''Look Who's Talking'' series.

==Early Life==
John Travolta and his twin brother, actor/comedian [[fag|Carrot Top]], were born [[at least 100 years ago]] in [[New Jersey]].  Their father was an [[Irish]] immigrant who worked in a coal mine and their mother was a concert [[penis|pianist]].  By his early [[13 year old boy|teens]], Travolta had already shown a certain knack for acting and auditioned for roles all the time, most of which he [[blowjob|easily won]]. In 1976, at the age of [[at least 100 years]] old he was trapped inside a bubble to stop his [[gayness]] fucking up society and forced to bubble fuck some dowdy bitch and shit. This was later blamed for his succeptibility to [[scientology]] headfucking techniques. He has his own themetune, it's all like naaah, nananana nah nah.


He is also known for his famous catch phrase

==Midlife Crisis (aka ''joining [[Scientology]]'')==
Travolta became a Scientologist after seeing one of their really persuasive [[television]] commercials.  He had been looking for direction ever since his movies ''Grease'' and ''Saturday Night Fever'' completely flopped and he found it in the form of paying people to rid his body of ancient, evil aliens.  It is estimated that Travolta has purchased $[[at least 100|1 billion]] worth of Scientological [[shit|horse shit]].

Shortly after joining, Travolta auditioned for the role of [[Goatse]] man but lost out to Rob Schneider.  That's why to this day he only performs in movies based on the writings of L. Ron Hubbard, like ''Battlefield Earth'', ''The Passion of the Christ'', and ''Throw Mamma from the Train''.

Because John is a sci-fag and doesn't believe in mental illnesses, he decided not to treat his autistic son as it's against the [[TOS]] of scientology.  His son Jett (like a plane [[fag|geddit]]?) had seizures and was diagnosed by teachers, psychologists & just about everyone the kid ever met.  Joey Travolta did a documentary about autistic kids and interviewed [[at least 100|65]] of them, which was still not enough to get Travolta to get his kid the help he needed.  

Jett slipped on a bathmat and joined the great Xenu in the after life, well at least he will as long as Travolta doesn't admit to the other sci-fags that his kid was a [[retard]].

If it is revealed that Jett intentionaly commited [[suicide]] and framed it as a bathmat fall because he couldn't bear to live with his dad's [[faggotry]], he will be considered [[an hero]] to us all. If it was a setup it is quite possible he did this simply [[for the lulz]].

===Scientology No More?===
Yet because Scientology is so full of [[AIDS]] and [[bullshit]], Travolta has apparently had it with their [[bullying|teachings]] and [[murder|way of life.]] Since they've blamed him for Jett's death, Travolta has become [[woman|embittered (yet terrified)]] of Scientology's subsequent [[sodomy|retaliation]]. Those rascally [[jews|Scientologists sure do like to hold onto]] their [[money|high-profile members]]..
