The purpose of the assembly was to discuss memes and the internet's effect on Amerikkka. [[lulzcon|'''I wonder where they got the idea for that.''']]

==Guests==
The convention showcased the creators of many unfunny [[old meme]]s.  Among the guests included were:
*[[lolcats|The thieves]] who stole Cat macros from [[4chan]]
*[[moot]]
*[[unfunny|Homestar Runner]]
*[[Roosterteeth|Red vs. Blue]]
*Oneredpaperclip
*[[Chuck Norris]] Facts
*Anal Dash from [[Livejournal]]

[[Kail]] was requested by the website commenters to be put on the guest list more than anyone, and even though [[Azn| Tim Hwang]] said he'd "work on it," nothing happened and that really just meant "stop asking, [[Fail| Kail]] is for faggots."

Seeing as all the guests included are on 4chan's most wanted list, this convention would have been quite convenient for [[Anonymous]] to wipe unfunny memes off the face of the earth, had they not been too busy with [[scientology|fighting the endless war]] and rehearsing for their [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grnNu0dhvdw ''rap careers'']].

Also among the attendees was Judith Donath, interweb expert who used [[TOW]]'s [[lolcats]] article as a reference on a research paper.[http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/donath.html]

Oh, Anonymous, don't worry, you're invited.  You're the "4chan forum people."  You can hang out with the "SA forum people" and punch furries together.
