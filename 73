'''2ch.ru''' (Russian: dvach) was the [[Russian]] version of [[4chan]]. It was created in 2006 and had [[fact|probably]] the most active userbase of any *chan except for [[Futaba]].

In early 2009 the site was abandoned by the owner, who was tired of all the [[CP]] being posted. Most people left for 2-ch.ru (Russian: tirech), a clone of the original site. Neckbeards hang out at [http://0chan.ru nullchan] and animefags at [http://dobrochan.ru/ dobrochan].

==Background==
[[Image:Zoi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Zoi in his human form]]
It is just another fucked up imageboard.  Russian, actually, which explains it.  However, unlike Futaba there are no [[Racism|restrictions for foreign IP’s]], hence [[spam|everyone can post]].

Russian [[moot]] is called [[Yaoi|Zoi]], but, [[Lie|unlike]] [[moot]], he is [[fat]], [[ugly]] and [[Vladimir Putin|straight]]. 

==Boards==
Dvach consists of [[Over 9000|more than 40]] boards: 6 discussion (site discussion, [[anime]], philosophy and other shit no one cares about), 25 special interest boards (cars, bikes, books, [[games]], [[Geek|programming]], [[music]], [[cats]], [[gay|fashion]] and so on) and whole 12 boards devoted solely to [[animu]].

[[Image:Ruscensored.JPG|thumb|130px|The Russian government began cracking down on illegal websites in late 2008. Dvach went down in January 2009. Coincidence? [[Prove me wrong|I THINK NOT]].]]

Dvach also has a random board located at http://2ch.ru/b/ so you won’t miss it.  It was created following the example of the big [[Bro|/b/ro]].  There are no rules, so everybody can post anything he or she want (except illegal stuff, it's [[illegal]] to post [[CP]] in Russia and it can [[Lie|result in being b& and v&]]).  /b/ also adopted 4chan’s talking style with its [[Retard|specific slang]].  Dvach's /b/ board is, unsurprisingly, most popular.  It used to get at least 5 million posts per day, and due to this (actually, due to endless meaningless spam by [[Rozen Maiden]] [[fags]] and [[Unix|Perl programmers]]) every post has to be verified by [[CAPTCHA]].  Doesn't stop spammers from spamming though.

Hentai ([[Hentai|/h/]], [[Tentacle rape|/ho/]], [[Yuri|/y/]], [[Yaoi|/u/]] and [[Cake|/ls/]]) boards were hidden and [[pr0n]] boards are closed due to [[attention]] from Police and KGB.  That’s what dvachers prefer to think, as sometimes dvach indeed consists solely of [[pr0n]] and [[cp]], due to floods (“wipes”).  In fact, dvach once raided pedo forums because [[Nerd rage|it was pissed off]] by their constant spam and arrogant replies.  The closing decision was made a few months ago when dvach's admin Zoi [[Attention whore|wanted to win]] the [[Shit nobody cares about|Best Runet Site Competition]] prize.  Of course, he [[fail]]ed.  Since than all adult-content-posters freely migrated to the Random board where now you can find almost anything you want, except real girls.

== Glorious people of dvach ==
[[Image:Cosplay 2ch.jpg|thumb|150px|Typical discussion: Yo.  I want to know, what character can I cosplay?  Tell me please.  Thank you in advance.  Also my height is 1.8 m, weight is 72 kg. Pic related. — You can [[cosplay]] a turd.]]
As any other popular chan, dvach is largely stratified.  Major groups were:
* [[Shota|Schoolboys]] (does not actually mean that such poster still attends high school).  Dumb and immature fucks which are to be replied with [[GTFO|“hurry, go to class, its really late!”]].
* [[Newfags]].  Unaware of the [[Rules of the internet|rules]], trying to force retarded [[meme]]s, and such.  Easy to spot.
* [[Oldfags]], the ones that saw the ''first'' 1-get in /b/.  Largely nonexistent.
* [[Rozen Maiden]](Official Rozen Maiden Thread) worshippers collectively known as “Doll-chan” (also applies to Doll-chan infected board), a cross-chan conspiracy of [[aspie]]s who, no matter what, will post and post and post images of Rozen Maiden dolls into their “Official Rozen Maiden” thread.  Sometimes knows as Rozenkreuzers.
* Bydło ([[Redneck|cattle]] in [[Poland|Polish]]), word used by geeks, basement dwellers, btards and other losers to describe "normal" people.
* Nebydło (un-cattle), bydlo's antipode — [[elitist]], usually Russia-hating dissident writers.  Easily trollable as well.
* Devoted [[trolls]], may appear as any of the above.
* [[Rozen Maiden]] worshippers moar like [[desu]]fags
* Whorefuckers — prostitution advocates. They like to discuss visited hookers and to troll permavirgins, basement dwellers and other dumbfucks that haven't sex.

==Memes==
[[Image:Bbpe.jpg|thumb|200px|Valeri Sütkin [[Image Macro|macro]]]]
[[Image:Final.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Memes of the dvach]]]]
* '''Valery Syutkin''' — he may look and sing a lot like [[Rick Astley]], but this impression is completely wrong: he will let you down, hurt you etc by punching you in your fucking whore face.  But only if you are a woman...  Unfunny forced meme posted over and over by the same retarded unde[[rage]] virgin.
* '''[[Leonidas|Leonid]] Vasilevski''' — the most trollable person in the world.  He was trolled to the point of killing his parents with a pistol (his father was a bigass official so it made it to the newspapers) and going to the militia (russian police).  This by far was the greatest impact dvach had on the [[real world]].
* '''[[Nigra|Black Overlord]]''' (Ben Gunn, the pornstar) because 2ch.ru is an anime forum for queers.
* '''Nomad''' — see [[Xynta]].
* '''Artemy Lebedev''', the designer famous for his rich obscene lexicon that he uses in his many reviews.
* '''Interesting person''' — the character of two videos from [[YouTube]], shot on a mobile phone. His favorite phrase is the requirement «Saw my door!», addressed to the two policemen. "Saw" means "Created".

and other, thousands of them

==Mascots==

No board is complete without [[Hentai|mascots]].  Dvach posters show infinite love towards them because mascots are a substitute for the [[real life]] which none of them has.

In first Slavya-chan’s thread she was already naked than on third picture and demonstrated genitals on sixths.  [[Virgins|Some dvachers]] don’t like her because of this whorish behaviour, but who cares about these fucks.  More prons to come, lads.
