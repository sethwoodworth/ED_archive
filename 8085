Telnet
Telnet is a Web 1.0 protocol for remotely connecting to a [[shell]]. Before the days of MySpace, LiveJournal, Facebook, Twitter, and especially 4chan, telnet was the only way to contact people farther than shouting distance.

==History of Telnet==
[[Image:Telnet.png|thumb|A typical response when attempting to telnet in. People are such pussies.]]

Telnet was one of the [[first post|first]] protocols designed for networking, back when networking was [[last thursday|a dream within a dream]]. Long before the world was plagued by [[blogs]] and teenage girls with LiveJournals, [[nerd|technological savvy]] individuals were using telnet to communicate with each other. 

Telnet is completely unencrypted and thus make a perfect gift wrap for your [[docs]]. This ensures the fastest possible connection and lowest overhead, since encryption just wastes CPU and makes more packets. Believe me, you aren't important enough to be sniffed.

===Current Uses for Telnet===
* Watch ascii [[CAPS|STAR WARS]] right fucking now.
* Accessing your [[Shit|kick ass homepage]] via [[UNIX]] shell
* Impress your [[Script kiddie]] friends
* Accessing [[Citadel]] systems in order to follow the text for [[drama]] and [[lulz]]
* Connecting to your computer from a public place and typing random shit in order to impress the chicks (this eventually leads to [[deleted fucking everything|formatting your hard drive]]).
* Connect to your ISP's router with the default password because your ISP is too stupid to hire a monkey smart enough to employ the most basic and fundamental concepts of network security, and then download much [[bestiality|donkey porn]]
