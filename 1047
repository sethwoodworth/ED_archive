The newest in the never ending line of [[shock sites]], '''Bloodshows.com''' is yet another [[original content|clone/ripoff]] of [[Ogrish]] and [[Rotten|Rotten.com]]. It began as '''4girls1mouth.com''', which was also another ripoff of [[2girls1cup]] that featured a five minute video of three women [[coprophilia|shitting into another girl's mouth]]. The site was originally a small collection of gore videos, but now has 31 different video rooms including not only gore, but also [[unfunny|humorous]] videos and an unregulated comment section that anyone can contribute to, officially demoting it to another version of [[/b/]] without the [[CP]]. As such, it has been relegated as a safe haven for [[sick fucks]] to mock dead people and claim that [[internet tough guy|they would've totally cockslapped death in the face if they were put in the same situation]].

The site was started by Joe Frankulin (don't mention his real name or he'll delete your comments, even though he already [http://www.bloodshows.com/html/Death%20Metal.html has mentioned it himself]), a.k.a. Drolsinatas, "Satan is Lord" spelled backward, which is so fucking [[gay|metal]] that it's a wonder that the internet hasn't imploded. He is the ex-guitarist for the doom [[metal]] band Goatlord, which was exactly how it sounds. After getting bored [[bestiality|dominating goats]], he got into death videos online after seeing [[Chechclear]]. The next logical step was to create a website that compiles videos that all he and his fans can [[masturbation|wank to]] every waking second.
