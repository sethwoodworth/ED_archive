Taking down ED
[[File:EDTakedown.jpg|center|RESISTANCE IS FUTILE]]<br/>
[[File:Cloaked_ip.jpg|thumb|Our hacker defense is state-of-the-art.]]
''Your heart starts beating faster. The room starts feeling colder. The sweat bursts out like a million fountains in your skin. It's worse than bad... '''Someone just made fun of you on the internet.'''''

There are two choices from here on out. You could say "[[lol internet]]", or you could do something much funnier. This article covers that second choice.

'''Taking down ED''', as you might expect, is something that is quite easy to do. By the time you're done reading this article, hopefully you'll have a better feel for the many ways to do this. It would appear that the majority of these attempts originate on [[YouTube]]. This is likely because [[vlog]]gers are scum. Their fans keep telling them how great everything they do is, and as a result they have a bad case of [[USI|runaway self-esteem.]]

We'll start with a rundown of past success stories.

==Stories==
===[[Feltcho]]===
Perhaps the original, Feltcho lolled us all by leaving [[Feltcho Voicemails|voicemails]] on [[Joseph Evers]]' machine. Remember: if you're not swearing, we're not listening.

If you're lucky, you'll become a [[:File:Thefelch.mp3|musical piece of ED history]].
===[[CircaRigel]]===
[[File:Belinda goofy 1.JPG|thumb|:O]]
[[hilarious|Raped as a child]], CircaRigel would forever have something to prove. One day she caught ED calling her friend [[Irish282]] a pedophile just because he was trying to [[rape|help out]] children. Naturally, she made it her duty to [[1337|/whois ED]] and post some completely inaccurate [[dox]]. 

By the way, it would later be confirmed that [[Irish282]] really is a pedo. [[gg]].

===[[Mike Sandy]]===

{{quote|So what about Dreamhost? Cant we trace the website's IP and I can use my [[skript kiddie|website hacking software]] to the hack the [[1337|internet protocol address]] of the website and server its hosted on (encyclopediadramatica.com), then the site will go down. All someone has to do is provide me with an IP address of DreamHost's webhost or the IP address of the server the website is hosted on|Mike Sandy, oblivious to the existence of fucking <strike>nslookup</strike> <strike>cmd</strike> terminal}}

===[[Rootbrian]]===
More than ever, the Internet makes it easy to become a Video Star from the comfort of your Canadian [[Welfare|public housing]], and there's no better proof than Rootbrian himself. Unfortunately, Brian didn't appreciate the fame we brought to him, so he put together a [[vlog]]ging crusade to bring down ED ([[Illiterate|Pronounced by Rootbrian]] sometimes like Ed, the Man's name, and other times with a long 'E' sound, like 'Eeeed'), which is still [[Failing|active]] to [[Last Thursday|this day]].
*Rootbrian got [[Your Mom|his Mom]] on video
*Rootbrian tried telling people not to [[donate]] to ED ([[Streisand Effect|Which got a lot more people donating]]).

===[[VampiricSpektor]]===
[[Image:VSversusED.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The whole thing in a nutshell.]]
Armed with L337 hacking skills, psychic powers so powerful that they could barely be contained within a giant fucking lump on her fivehead, lactating man-dog-tits large enough to feed all of Haiti, and a sturdy pair of orthopedic shoes, VampiricSpektor poses a triple-threat to ED's continued existence on the interwebs.
{{quote|If I have to I'll get the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] hacked. You stupid motherfucking shits.|VampiricSpektor|<s>she's</s> It's going to hax us}}
{{quote|Guys we have won a great victory...[[Incest|my brother and i and my dad joined together]] and deleted EVERY peice of information on every site that the malcurian and Murkyurine have been on....my mission was too Delete and destroy Encyclopediadramaticas page about me...but it came with great cost....i made myself a target for hackers....Trust? me...that page has been [[1337|manipulated and distorted with all sorts of Codes]] my Friend [[Steve Hodder-Watt|Steve]] gave me...its gonna keep them occupied kekekekekekekeke XD|{{youtube2|VampiricSpektor|VampiricSpektor}}|after [[BLANKING IN PROGRESS|blanking]] this page.}}

Those wishing to emulate VS must remember to make videos calling ED illegal while trying your very hardest to get someone to [[legal|bomb their server]]... and you'll probably need a sturdy pair of orthopedic shoes.

===[[Steve Hodder-Watt]]===
One day, after returning from a walkabout in the bush, Steve Hodder-Watt, a Waboriginal native of Australia, bumbled across the ED article about Aborigines. Without realizing that ED has an article on just about every race there is out there (new articles are created as new races are discovered), Steve immediately [[Retard|jumped to the conclusion that ED is a racist site]]. He then asked his lawyer to put the squeeze on Google, to have ED removed from the Internet.

Naturally, this gave him assloads of [[Streisand Effect|media attention]].

=== [[Nate Glenn]] ===
N8glenn rolled his Jihad on ED by creating a new ED account every day, and use it to spam a few Islame- or Yahud-related articles with links to his utterly brain-dead Youtube videos. Dodging the banhammer like this is certainly not trivial technically since every time he gets banned he had to find an IP from an entirely different range. Wardriving comes to mind, since it looked very much like a daily routine (find an unsecured WiFi on the way home from work, masturbate vigorously while looking at some kids walking by, oh, and spam ED).

Since it takes less than two minutes to "Revert. Ban. Ignore.", the effort ratio suggests that n8glenn must have no life whatsoever in order to waste it on doing this. Although one kinda can tell that by looking at him too. The only thing lamer than what he is doing would be - well - writing an article about a guy whose time is that worthless. Oh boy, that was one unpleasant realisation.

==Methods==
===Delete Fucking Everything===
Making a [[sockpuppet]] account and just [[Delete Fucking Everything|blanking]] everything you see, not knowing the article can be revived in a matter of seconds. The only thing this method is good for is giving you [[Streisand Effect|even more attention]].

===Blog!===
[[File:Normanjaydenbawww.JPG|thumb|Learn to take down big business in college. Cause when I think of big business, I think of ED.]]
[[File:NormanJaydenwat.JPG|thumb|Keep telling yourself that..]]
Write an angry [[blog]]! This is usually used in conjunction with one of the others below.
Click [http://norman-jayden.deviantart.com/journal/30360242/ here] and [http://norman-jayden.deviantart.com/journal/30438435/ here] to see how people so ridiculously [[butthurt]] will pretend as if they are absolutely not bothered.
Note, also, how they claim victory where there is only utter fail.
This is a typical method of trying to cover up an initial [[BAWWWWW]] reaction or a failed attempt at humoring the "Don't Feed the Trolls" myth.

===Threaten a lawsuit===
A favorite of many, make bogus legal threats. If you like, you can actually bother seeing a [[attorney at lol|lawyer]] so he can laugh you out of his office.

However, [[Grace Saunders|sending bullshit cease and desists will bring the page down and it will never come back.  Also, your information will not be posted.]]
===Beg troll groups===
Try making a post on an [[4chan|anonymous image board]] about how evil ED is. But leave out the part about us having an article on you or you'll be banished to [[personal army]] hell.
===Publishing dox===
You might be able to [[Google]] some EDiots [[dox]]. It is strongly recommended to publish these on your [[YouTube]]. [[irony|That'll show them for dropping dox!]]
===Online petition===
{{quote|Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to '''petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'''|[[Freedom|The Bill of Rights]]}}

The founding fathers guaranteed your right to petition. While it doesn't say anything about the government listening to your petition, you are always free to make internet petitions on sketchy websites. You might be able to get 10 signatures before some [[memefag]]s come flood your shit. A common response to this is ''[[emoticon|:D]] my petition is getting many signatures!''. Make no mistake, [[Fact|internet petitions have never done anything]]. Ever.

So go sign [http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/closedownED/ this one] for the hell of it, courtesy of [[Linkaton_Furaito|Linkaton Furaito]] and [[Explosiv22|Explosiv22]].  Because, you know...that's going to stop bad things from being said on the internet.

===[[Template:Mine]]===
{{mine}}

The proper way to destroy ED articles.
===[[Computer Science III]]===
Be just like Neo! The powers of DDOS, virus-programming, database hacking and more are right there at your fingertips! They teach this stuff in High School! Really!
===[[Jessi Slaughter|Involve your parents]]===
Chances are, if you want an article eradicated from ED, you still live with your parents! Why yes, nobody else in this world knows more about clothing, housing, feeding and protecting you like your good 'ol Maw and Paw! They'll show those mean 'ol [[EDiots]] what for!
===Tell your FBI friend===
Everyone has a friend who totally works for the FBI. Why not try to use him like a regular [[fat chick]]? I mean, the FBI [[cp|isn't]] [[terrorism|working]] [[murder|on]] [[rape|anything]] [[weev|better]]. It's your tax dollars, your net personality is entitled to protection.
===Tell Google to remove them from the Internet!===
*''Only works for [[abbos]] in [[Australia]].''
===Leave messages on [[Joseph Evers]]' voicemail===
Please do this. Everytime you yell, part of the HD gets erased.
===Sysop War===
[[File:Sheneequakillhamster.jpg|center|thumb|Cause this to happen|400px]]
{{clear}}
===Hex them!===
[[File:Divineangeldawhoop.jpg|thumb|[[DivineAngel]] knows that ED is not killable through ''conventional'' weapons.]]
Some people are simply stupid. Some are ignorant of the law. However, if your preferred path is [[crazy]], you can try [[DivineAngel]]'s method of hexing us. After she hexed us, [[2008]] was slightly less lulzy. So, for lack of evidence, hexing is the most successful method yet. 

If you don't believe in all that dirty voodoo magic [[Vampiricspektor|you could try cursing us, which is of course totally kosher in God's eyes]]. The viability of this method is still under investigation, pending CT scans of all sysops and a scan of the servers for any thurmatological buildups. If you come on ED and the page suddenly starts flashing runic symbols, please inform [[Joseph_Evers|Joseph Evers]] immediately.
===Take Anti-ED Pills.===
[[File:Anti-ed_pills.JPG|center|Ask your trusted Spam-Email Supplier.]]

===Participate in Pride-I mean Spirit day===
Of course, there are some people that aren't in it for the [[lulz]]. These people are either over concerned parents that were too late to see what the hell their kid was doing beforehand and decided "the internet isn't a safe place for children, or the other type is usually [[homosexual|different]]. Apparently some flaming faggots got all [[emo|emotional]] and [[crybaby|depressed]], so they committed suicide. Guess most parents weren't too [[crybaby|happy]] about the whole ordeal and decided to pass a "[[lie|Spirit Day]]" Which is supposed to "wipe out cyber-bullying", even though they know that cyber-bullying is just an internet form of bullying, albeit more lulzy. So if you aren't in it for the lulz, be sure to fag it up with your stupid teachers to remember all of the [[homosexual|Fags]] that gave their lives for the lulz.
