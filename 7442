'''Shaye Saint John''' is a fucked-up [[furry]] [[transsexual]] actor/model wannabe or one of the greatest trolls in Internet history. His/her/its inherent hatred for our modern world and it's moronic pursuit of fame and stardom through any self-degrading means lead to the birth of this representation of the ultimate plastic attention whore. She/he/it holds the record for highest number of mental deficiencies, as well as fake awards for his/her/its acting.  He/she/it pushes around a mannequin dressed like a [[whore|hooker]] in a wheelchair, and people pay him/her/it to take pictures, which is what he/she/it means by "acting." His/she/it's purposeful lack of humor and his/her/it's [[attention whore|attention whoring]] make his/her/its [[LiveJournal]] and comments comically difficult to read, but he still has a [[fucktard]] [[Goth]] fan base which he mocks and derides with pleasure. Quite a few people believe "he/she/it" is behind or somehow related to the bizarre hijackings of two Chicago television stations, WGN9 and WTT11, in 1987.  This is not the case but would be something he/she/it would approve of.

On April 20th, 2010, it was announced on Shaye's [[MySpace]] by his [[Homosexual|acquaintance]], Randolph Kret, that Shaye had died on February 25, 2010 from gastrointestinal bleeding in Southern California. The most likely cause of death was alcohol poisoning as he/she/it was fighting a deep bout of depression from living in this shitty world and fell into a bottle. Rest in peace, you crazy fucker.

==The site== 
At first glance, the site looks like something [[Lowtax]] might've made ten years ago as a joke. The layout is horrible, and there are about six million [[GIF]]s of badly-dressed inflatable dolls, mannequins, and porcelain dolls. Nearly every page has either background [[music]] or narration from Shaye Saint John talking in an Eric Cartman voice, although slightly higher-pitched.  It is maximized as nightmare fuel and is a perfect representation of the 15 minute syndrome which has plagued our society for decades.
