'''Tourneyfags''', short for "''Tournament Faggot''", is singlehandedly the most embarrassing thing to ever rear its distended head into the world of 
video gaming--even more embarrassing than being caught masturbating to ''Dead or Alive: Extreme Beach Volleyball'' by your grandmother. Tourneyfags like to take flawless video games such as ''[[Super Smash Bros|Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and beat the living shit out of it with completely unnecessary rules. Now that ''Brawl'' is available, their unnecessary revisions result in not so much ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', but ''[[BAWW|Super Smash Bros. BAWWWWWWW]]''.

At these tournaments, all the basement-dwellers get together with their [[penis|Gamecube]]s and spend [[at least 100|several]] hours <s>[[circle jerk]]ing</s> waiting to touch a damn [[penis|controller]] and actually play the game in the biggest [[sausage]] fest on Earth. After your five to eight minutes of playing, you get to wait [[9000|several more]] hours to play again, unless you lost your last match, in which case you can either [[GTFO|leave]] or stay and watch the rabid fanboyism. Either way, the day will end with you alone in your basement, crying, and wondering where your life went wrong.

All tourneyfags desperately want Super Smash Bros. to be a competitive fighting game like [[Street Fighter]], but of course this will never happen, since the game is completely geared towards [[Wii|casualfags]]. In fact, most self-imposed tourneyfag rules are aimed towards making the game more like Street Fighter anyway. [[LOL_WUT|So why don't they just play Street Fighter]]? The answer is simple: they're [[retard]]s who love [[Nintendo]]'s [[shit]]ty [[Mario|characters]].

==Types of Tourneyfags==
[[Image:Tournyfag shitty comic.png|right|frameless|215px]]

*'''Casual Fag''' - These are the type of people who show up to tournaments with absolutely no idea what any of the rules are and provoke the ensuing wrath of the Typical Tourneyfags; they may even choose their [[wat|favorite character]]. They may actually defeat some of the Typical Tourneyfags since they're more or less on the same level of [[skillz]]. The only thing that really separates them is whether or not they actually bothered to memorize the rules. There's a 50/50 chance that the Casual Fag will get sucked into the never ending spiral of self-destruction that is Tourney-faggotry or leave the scene forever as they realized that tourneyfags fail hard.

*'''The Professional''' - These most likely [[azn]] players have dedicated their lives into getting [[really]] good at playing the game. You stand no chance against them unless you are a Professional Tourneyfag like they are, in which case you're just as much a loser as them. They know all the rules by heart, and have carefully calculated every statistic to give them the mathematical advantage over their opponent. Normally these Tourneyfags are saving their virginity for [[Zelda]] or [[Mario|Princess Peach]], and have a severe case of basement dweller-ism. Despite all this, they're not all that annoying, because they're able to shut the fuck up for a few minutes.

*'''Typical Tourneyfag''' - This type of Tourneyfag is not as dedicated as the Professional, but they're really damn close to failing just as hard as them. They use their favorite character while acknowledging their disadvantages, but occasionally choose a [[loser|less popular]] character simply for the sake of wanting to win, with no intention of having any fun. They tend to disagree with some of the rules unless they want to [[buttsecks|ass kiss]] the moron who wrote them. They're the most annoying type of Tourneyfag, because they're fucking everywhere. You can most likely find them foaming at the mouth while yelling at someone.

==B& FAGGOT! U R NOT FAIR AND BALANCED!!1==
[[Image:Tourneyfag itam gaem.jpg|thumb|Dont U touch dat INNOVASHUN!!1]]
[[Image:Stupid_tourneyfag.PNG|thumb|A tourneyfag saying he is NOT a tourneyfag? Oh wow.]]
Do you have a favorite character, a favorite stage, and/or a favorite item? There's a <s>98%</s> 100% chance that the Tourneyfags have banned all three from being used. Why? To be simply put, they do it to make the game '''"[[Fox News|fair and balanced]]."''' For example, certain stages provide "[[Crybaby|unfair defensive positions]]" (ie: the far right cloud in Yoshi's Island). The correct thing to do when a person has an "[[Crybaby|unfair defensive position]]" is run over, <i>kick their fucking ass, and '''TAKE THE DAMN POSITION.'''</i> What the Tourneyfags prefer to do is bitch and moan about it until the stage is [[banhammer]]ed. That's why Tourneyfags are gay for Final Destination, there are no "[[Crybaby|unfair defensive positions]]."(Even though some fighters have bad or no projecttile attack.) 

Items are also banned. Sometimes just certain items that give "unfair advantages" like the superstar or [[banhammer|hammer]] which makes a character [[SysOp|invincible]], or items that [[cure|replenish heath]]. What the Tourneyfags fail to realize is that items [[random]]ly spawn, meaning that your character has just as good a chance to nab an item as another character does. Deactivating items is a matter of preferences, but the Tourneyfags are [[emo]] bitches about it. Ironically tourneyfags abuse exploits to the extreme, then bitch at the developers when they fix it so they can't glitch up to whatever ledge has whatever power armor.

Characters have been getting banned, too. The current [[faggotry|debate]] going on in the tourneyfag community is whether to [[banhammer|ban]] Metaknight or let him stay in the their game. Tourneyfags, however, would ban anything just to have the game [[lie|"balanced"]], so expect your favorite characters getting the [[banhammer]] soon.

There is no video game in existence that's perfectly "fair and balanced;" players are always going to find exploits and ways that certain characters can be made more powerful than the rest. Tourneyfags simply water down the game until they're left with this gray, mushy [[abortion]] that Nintendo never wanted in the first place.

{{quote|What I don't understand about tourneyfags is, wouldn't being best at the game mean you just dominate all aspects of it? Wouldn't being the best mean that no matter what items or settings there were, you could adapt and overcome?|Anonymous Casualfag, being a non-faggot}}

==Smashboards==
[[Image:Mew2King.jpg|thumb|The tourneyfag lifecycle being ended by contact with a female]]
''SmashBoards'', the primary focus of this article, is a [[Super Smash Bros]] dedicated forum full of these tourneyfags that call themselves "Pro Smash Players". Most of the topics on this forum are arguments about whether Brawl or Melee is better, so-called facts that are really just opinions without any actual basis behind them, and Brawl screenshots that claim to be [[uncyclopedia|funny]], such as [[Solid Snake's Ass]], or the inevitable Princess Peach [[pantyshot]]. They do not take very kindly to [[newfag]]s, as they are often shit upon and blacklisted from every VIP forum if they are unable to interpret any of their inside jokes and/or jargon; most of these are viewable [[Tourneyfag#Tourneyfag Jargon|here]].

[[Image:Realmenuseitems.png|thumb|Masahiro Sakurai takes another jab at the tourneyfags, hitting them [[balls|where it hurts most]].]]
[[Image:Satoru Iwata 2.JPG|thumb|Use this picture as Tourneyfag Kryptonite.]]
In January 2008, before ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' hit shelves in Godzilla Land, [http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/ssbb/vol3_page1.jsp wii.com] began to post a series of interviews between Masahiro Sakurai, the creator of ''Smash Bros.'', and Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo. In the third installment of the interview, the two touched on the topic of online gameplay: how to create an unlulzy atmosphere free of harassment, but more importantly, how they could stick it to the tourneyfags. Online play was created with the [[Wii#Casual_Gamers|casual gaming faggots]] in mind, which shouldn't be a surprise given Nintendo's targeting that demographic specifically.

{{squote|...online gaming had always been a place for the strong. One person [tourneyfags] would be living it up while hundreds or thousands of people [casual gamers] were unhappy... as long as things remain this way, online gaming can spread only so far. ...Even if people thought [the game] looked interesting, most would hesitate to get involved and stay lingering on the sidelines. ... [Brawl] would be more about the fun of sharing rather than simply competing. ... Those in the top five might feel pretty good about themselves, but what happens if you’re number 15,398 in the rankings? People considered formidable in their own particular community wouldn’t be the least bit pleased.|Satoru Iwata, saying Casualfags > Tourneyfags}}

{{squote|When people think of playing Smash Bros. online, they think about battling opponents to see what happens based on their record of wins or losses, or about holding tournaments online. But I felt that this would make it a service from which only '''a select group of players''' [tourneyfags] could derive enjoyment. For Smash Bros., there are small communities here and there where there’s fun in winning and losing, even when there are more skilled players than others. But if you make an environment where everyone is trying to climb their way to the top of a single tall mountain, it’s clear that the people having fun would be limited to a '''small number of individuals'''.|Masahiro Sakurai, telling tourneyfags to fuck off}}

==Memorable Quotes==
{{co|tourneymemquotes|[COLLAPSE]|[EXPAND]|0|
{{quote|A few items like motion-sensor bombs, super scopes, and bombs can dramatically unbalance gameplay.|Typical Tourneyfag being a fucking crybaby.}}

{{quote|You can't practice "luck". You can't choose to have "luck". it wouldn't be fair to the person who actually tries to win and puts his all into it to lose because a pill that JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE FUCKING EXPLOSIVE kills him, or that a bomb-omb that JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE NEXT TO HIM kills him, or that sort of ilk.|A Tourneyfag that JUST SO HAPPENS to be unable to get out of the way.}}

{{quote|There fact that it is possible to turn off items presumably means that some matches were meant to be played with them off. No one likes them in tournies because it allows the weaker player to win if they get sufficiently lucky, and when there is a prize for the ultimate winner, that sucks balls.|No Tourney player can handle items on a stage ever.}}

{{quote|Are you talking about wavedashing? I don't consider it a glitch, but I digress. Wavedashing is a short burst of movement that only a handful of characters can take advantage of. Not exactly game breaking.|Not exactly game breaking, but Tourneyfags can't win without it.}}

{{quote|If the choice is either full on tourneytard or ultra-casual not even caring who wins, I'll go tourney myself. The whole point of competition is to do your best to win.

{{quote|Yea, but a random change in the stage, though you know its coming can turn a strategy over and everybody knows that if you're so into the game the fact you have to jump to a platform instead of hitting your enemy is going to piss you off, thats why all tourney fags use maps you can Waveshine on|A Tourneyfag preferring a game where he doesn't have to move.}}

{{quote|the point of a tournament is being able to fight each other without any sort of outside influence affecting the fight, to show who is more skilled than another. having an "off day" has nothing to do with being skilled or trying your hardest, and shouldn't have to affect a regular, balanced fight.|A Tourneyfag who's obviously never heard of Street Fighter.}}

{{quote|it removes the more random parts of it to try and make it into a more balanced fighter. it takes away what makes it a casual, jump-in sort of game, and molds it into the kind of game that can be practiced, the kind of game that actually is at least more equal. some people find a battle of equality, where no one can get an upper hand due to a retarded deus ex machina, and where the only thing that you can be graded on is how well you can execute your moves and keep focused. but of course, NOPE, IT HAS TO HAVE BOB-OMBS AND SUPER FLAT ZONE AND BE COMPLETELY RANDOM AND WACKY LOL TO BE FUN ^^ DESU-NE. die slowly in a fire.|A Tourneyfag who can't handle a real fighting game has to make Smash Bros. the same.}}

{{quote|Tourneyfags are the shit killing ALL video games in general. They can't handle the heat of items so they turn it off. They can't handle the way a map works so they ban it. They can't handle the way a character outmatches Fox so they ban it. But they don't ban bugs and exploits....right and WE'RE the scrubs"|A Casualfag describing Tourneyfags perfectly.}}

{{quote|Fixing the game so the only stages or methods of gameplay you can use benefits a grand total of maybe five characters tops doesn't seem like "fair and even" to me. What about characters like Mewtwo, who benefit from items and are thus totally fucking shafted? or characters who would do well on moving stages who are once again fucked for Final Destination/Battlefield? Balancing the game in favor of certain characters doesn't seem like balancing it at all, it seems like fucking it up.|Captain Obvious}}

{{quote|PrakirJaq, you are correct, I believe the animation is called "landfall special." I made a huge post about the mechanics of wavedashing in another thread. It's not a glitch. Technically none of the exploits we frequently use are glitches, which is rare. But as Mookie said, glitch vs. exploit is just an argument in semantics.

{{quote|To be honest, I think it's actually good Evo decided to put items and not ban certain stages. Why? Because it actually would make you work harder to "fight against luck".

[[Image:Tourneyfag Post.jpg|thumb|[[HA HA HA, OH WOW]]]]
[[Image:Bannedstage.jpg|thumb|Masahrio Sakurai yet again shows tourneyfags how ''Brawl'' is supposed to be played.]]
Tourneyfags think they are so [[Fail|awesome]] by having a lot of esoteric and gay jargon roughly equivalent to memes:

*'''Azndash''': [[Azn|Azndash]] is based after a person who failed horribly and "wavedashed" off a stage.
*'''[[Burger King|BK]]''': Bk is a phrase used by [[fat]] tourneyfags which means "bad kid".
*'''Bowsercide/Koopa Kamikaze''': In ''Brawl'', Bowser has a special move that allows him to grab a foe, jump up, and squash them with his [[fat]] body. If he jumps up while over an edge, [[an hero|both characters will plummet into the pit]]. Other variants include DKcide, Kirbicide, and Regecide (Ganon and King Dedede).
*'''Edgehog''': The act of waiting for your opponent to get close to the edge after you send them flying, at which point you jump off and grab said edge just before they do, thus causing the foe to [[pwnt|helplessly plummet to their doom]], since only one person can hang from the ledge at a time. Unlike other tourneyfag techniques, performing this requires [[n00b|minimal skill]].
*'''Jiggs''': Faggy way of saying Jigglypuff.
*'''Knee''': Since all tourneyfags are gay for Captain Falcon, one of his moves, the "knee", is constantly hailed as awesome by the tourneyfags solely because they have fantasies of Captain Falcon [[falcon punch|raping their asshole]] with his knee. 
*'''L-Canceling/Washdashing/Dash Dancing etc''': Glitchy faggotry that Melee fags believe is skill.
*'''Mindgames''': Since tourneyfags [[retards|thnk thy r soh smrt]], they've created a [[Goatse|"Mindgames"]] class of play in which you do some fancy move to distract your opponent.
*'''[[Dylan_Tnga|Scrub]]''': People who don't follow tourneyfag rules.
*'''Shining''': A tourneyfag's greatest dream. [[furry|Fox]] [[shit nobody cares about|has to get you in a corner, and press down-B many times]]. Final Destination remains the only available and unbanned stage because of this.
*'''Shorthop/Fast-Fall Lag Cancel''': Since ''Smash Bros.'' is a [[Lies|"Serious Fighting Game"]] and the characters need to be really, really fast, Tourneyfags decided to remove jumping via this method.
*'''Stafy, why are you here?''': A [[forced meme]] started by the SmashBoards based on a podcast, which, after much circle jerking, the Smashtards pointed out Stafy's general [[Mexican|uselessness]] and Sakurai's Hate for anything remotely similar to his ideas. Despite this being true, it was never funny. Never. Still repeated by SmashBoards visitors as if it were [[fail|awesome]].
*'''Tipper''': Hitting opponents with the [[head|tip]] of a [[Penis|weapon]].
*'''Tier List''': [[shit nobody cares about|A ranking of characters divided into categories by perceived strength at the highest level of play, assuming that both players are equally skilled, with the usual rules of no items and Final Destination.]]
*'''Tires don exits''': A [[Milhouse|meme]] made by the tourneyfags. Misspelled "Tiers Don't Exist", Tourneyfags have adopted it as "hilarious" because to them, [[Lies|only idiots would criticize Melee]]. [http://www.t-shirtmojo.com/p-Tires_don_exits-10082.html They've also made a t-shirt].
