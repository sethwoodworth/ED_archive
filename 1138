[[Image:My_New_ID_by_Branca.jpg|thumb|180px|Branca would lead us to believe that a playboy rockstar who can [[fuck]] any [[pussy]] he wants would decide to ''exclusively'' hit (and marry) this. Can we say [[unrealistic expectations|thinly veiled wish fulfillment]]?]]
'''Branca''' is the prime example of the generic [[Mary Sue]], but she is unique in her mediocrity and ridiculous popularity. Somehow horribly raping the [[Gorillaz]] with childish fandom and comics about herself and her love life with a fictitious lead singer has earned her more than 300,000 pageviews and about 700 watchers on the bastion of high brow sophisticates with discerning artistic taste that is DeviantART.
[[Image:Housemaidg.jpg|thumb|left|For the [[lulz]]: Branca's more accurate [[self-insert|beginning]] in Kong Studios. The picture taken from [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6YRyir3GUI here] sums up everything.]]
==History==

{{quote|<small><small>Thanks a lot for ruining Gorillaz for me you stupid cow </small></small>|[[H8r|Muaka1]] - making as much [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/990917/817186272 drama] as Branca does.}}

[[Image:Google_Branca.gif|thumb|Even [[Google]] is smart]]
[[Image:Omgbebeh.jpg|thumb|right|Fractured eye sockets are genetic, and the same goes for azure hair.]]
[[Image:Shesbrazilian.jpg|thumb|left| She's a pro! Deffo.]]
[[Image:Bcomparison.jpg|thumb|left|Predictably, Branca's self-insert [[Mary Sue]] looks nothing like her. Yet unlike most [[internets]] fangirls, Branca can't even muster the talent to make her Sue look anything close to attractive.]]
 Branca was born many years ago, when the internet was still young, and seemed to have arrived on there like a bombshell, dropping dozens of drawings depicting her [[Mary Sue|alter ego]], Branca, as the somehow both pretentiously 'loving' and [[ugly|cute]] and somewhat lascivious and vulgar [[Whore|wife]] of the Gorillaz's cartoon lead singer 2D. Despite 2D's character being written by the creators as quite the '[[nigra|playa]]', he immediately falls for the puppy-punching charms of Branca and knocks her up in the context of [[marriage|sweet, schlong-shackling monogamy]]. From this moment on, the genetics theory went to pot (or Tusspot. Whatever) as the two produce a blue-haired, no-eyed abomination against [[Raptor Jesus|God]]. The fact that she can't come up with anything besides a generic, childish notion of domestic bliss to express her manic "love" for a fictional famous frontman is also pretty [[stupid|telling]]. [[Image:Wtfboobs.jpg|thumb|right|Misplaced boobs?]]

Countless zany, mostly annoyingly clean-cut (apart from the [[Porn|nudity]]), badly drawn comic adventures followed to convey their daily life as a [[Lie|happy family]] and, most importantly, highlight Branca's apparent existence in the life of the Gorillaz. Oddly, this includes the character Murdoc, despite the fact that he would probably take a bite out of the baby if given the chance. Murdoc is always referred to by Branca as her 'buddy', even though she says he's ugly, dirty, horny and [[gay]]. It doesn't matter anyway, because, like the rest of Gorillaz, he doesn't fucking exist. But Branca is so amazing she can tame even the BIGGEST ASSHAT BAND MEMBER. Man, she is as infectious as ''[[AIDS]]''! Stupid Gorillaz [[fangirl]]s naturally praise Branca and wish to be [[attention whore|like her]], even knowing they're only playing the role of the nice and friendly pals in the vain hope that Branca will draw them with 2D and thus somehow canonize their [[retard]]ed fantasies.

Despite being 27 years old, [[fat|in fit shape]] and [[Marriage|married]], you could say that Branca is the role model for [[16 year old girls|16 year old]] [[Suethor]]s on the [[internets]]. Perish forbid.

== The Comics ==
[[Image:Branca_is_NOT_violent.jpg|thumb|Branca wouldn't hurt a fly. Only her "husband" and "friends", and any innocent bystanders.]][[Image:Image3.jpg|thumb|left|Branca doing what she does best: annoying Gorillaz by asking for their constant attention.]]
Branca not only makes [[shit]]loads of [[fugly|beautiful]] drawings featuring the Gorillaz and her [[slut|gorgeous]] self, but she's also drawn [[over 9000]] comics just to be sure the world knows that she is the sole focus of the imaginary band's life (in other words, Branca is the [[attention whore|protagonist]] and the Gorillaz members get the supporting role). The comics are usually divided into two or more parts and very crudely drawn. This comes as little surprise because, in fact, Branca never puts time and love into her art. She's just doing it for the [[internet celebrity|internet fame]]. Also of note is her complete mastery of the [[Engrish]] language. The stories always end in one place: in bed. Why? Because 2D is her husband, and [[hawt|physical attraction]] [[Twilight|is all their relationship is built on!]]
[[Image:LETSMAEKSEX.jpg|thumb|left|Here's a more formal term for '''Let's [[fuck]]!'''.]] 
[[Image:Teh_paula.jpg|thumb|right|Here's Paula Cracker. 2D's taste in women has taken a turn for [[Mary Sue|the worst]].]]
[[Image:2dpaula.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fanart]] showing 2D kissing Paula. Branca will probably [[Castration|chop off his penis]] for that, as shown in many comics that she recently [[baleeted]] in order to [[Nice try|try to look wholesome and nice.]]]]
Branca will make a fuss if you mess with the characters she invented (see gallery). If you draw her [[fanart]] so something is "wrong" (i. e. the color of the hair is too light, the anatomy is sound and the characters don't look as if they're made of rubber, etc.), she will [[emo|bitch endlessly about it]], pointing out she made a precious [[TL;DR|Q & A]] for her characters. But when it's her turn to draw guest characters, she messes up all of their personalities, portrays all of the Gorillaz completely out of character, and does the same to the characters of other pathetic [[internets]] [[art]]ists as well.

She also transformed the character [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz#Additional_members Paula Cracker] (2D's ex-girlfriend who cheated on him with Murdoc in the actual, [[lame]], unnecessary Gorillaz storyline) into an [[evil]] bitch who plots every minute to steal 2D from [[Idiot|sweet and wholesome]] Branca. This is particularly [[retard]]ed, seeing as Paula is part of a backstory and was out of the Gorillaz scene '''before''' the then all-male band somehow acquired Noodle. What's the point of ''exhumating'' a character just to make a couple of cheap soap-opera [[drama]] comics? Oh, we guess that ''is'' the point. As we all know, if there's one thing [[fangirl]]s love, it's trite, generic, [[cliché]] melodrama.

Branca also hates slash pairings because they nullify her fake marriage as seen here in a conversation over a user posting that Murdoc and 2D was the OTP:
[[Image:Mawwiage.JPG|thumb|right|Hypocrite much?]]

==The Fanbase==
[[Image:Brancalol.jpg|thumb|left|BETTER ARTISTS H8 BRANCA.]]
[[Image:Support_Branca.PNG|thumb|left|14 year old militant Branca fans mean SERIOUS BUSINESS.]]
Branca tries her hardest to convince people that she's [[lie|not at DevianTART because she wants to be famous and loved and ass-patted]]. She's a serious ''arteest'', and she proves this by drawing her ugly Sue in the nude or in tiny lingerie, preferably in the bedroom together with her "husband". But Branca definitely isn't just a face in the crowd of conceited [[attention whore]]s, all she humbly requests is that you tell her she is kind, sweet, sexy and wonderful in every single communication. This is the part where the [[fan]]s enter the picture. After all, what would Branca be without a [[fuck]]ton of mindless followers who praise and [[huggle]] her like she does her own [[stupid]] self? 
[[Image:Fanines.jpg|thumb|Fanine. The word is a mixture of "fanbase" and "asinine".]]
Let it be known that if you actually try to criticize Branca, her legions of rabid [[fucktard]] fans, who are apparently at her every beck and call, will pounce on you like Auschwitz guard dogs on a Jew. Whenever a person gives Branca a "bad comment" ([[Suethor]]-speak for "critique"), or asks her WHY ON EARTH she hates [[gay]]s enough to constantly make rude remarks about them, this person will immediately be classified as an 'immoral and stupid [[16-year-old]] bitch', who is obviously VERY jealous of Branca's great artistic talent. Why else would anyone be so mean to their favorite artist? It's obviously [[bullshit|jealousy]]! 
[[Image:Slaves.jpg|thumb|We should have known: her fanclub is made of pure [[Slavery|love]]. Little floating hearts? That's [[Lesbian|friendship]]!]]
Her fanbase consists mostly of other [[fangirls]] (and occasionally a pathetic sexually repressed [[fanboy]] or two) and horrifically enough these cattle-like masses had created a club, [http://fanines-of-branca.deviantart.com/ Fanines of Branca], where other fantards could post comics and drawings about Branca and 2D's "romantical romance" and support the pairing even though [[batshit|most of them would prefer to be in her place]]. [[Image:Amigos_by_Branca.jpg|thumb|She's trying to get the [[fantard]]s together again.]] The artwork was either worse or better than her own work (occasionally they make self-insertions too), but still falling below the bar of utter [[shit]] as with most of the art on DeviantART.
The fanclub page, which was made because of the remarks from a brilliant [[troll]] named [http://fernet.deviantart.com/ Fernet], is abandoned nowadays. Thank you, Fernet.

==Acts of Asshattery==

===Search for a Star===
[[Image:There_s_something_wrong_here_by_Branca.jpg|thumb|left|Branca's truly awful contest entry and the future source of endless whining.]][[Image:intellectuals.jpg|thumb|Might be another contest entry or just her usual [[shit]], but it is full of [[AIDS]] either way.]]  
Branca also entered the Gorillaz's "Search for a Star" contest, where thousands of artists (some exceptionally talented, some...not so much) contributed their artwork in hopes of receiving prizes and perhaps even a job as the new official Gorillaz artist. Branca submitted a [[crap|masterpiece]] and yet, strangely enough, the powers that be were not as impressed by her talent as she herself was and deeply [[offended]] Branca by ignoring it along with thousands of other equally shitty entries.

Devastated and brokenhearted, Branca aimlessly wandered the red-light districts of London (where she thinks Essex is located), looking for something to brighten up her mood. When first discovering she had encountered a problem sex could not solve, she panicked. After a few days of screaming and whining and rubbing her honkers on innocents for some quick ego-boosting, she let the malicious part of her brain take over. The result was an insulting parody of a piece of artwork by the winner of the contest (a [[Scientist|professional artist]] named  Irina Bolshakova.) Mental [[masturbation]] aside, this was a great opportunity to have her poor, mangled ego pumped up once again by her [[13-year-old boy|admirers]] who would tell her [[lies|the judges were blind and that Branca should have won]]. Bolshakova may have seamlessly adapted Jamie Hewlett's style, but BRANCA IS 2D'S FUCKING MISTRESS AND DESERVES [[Paris Hilton|SPECIAL FUCKING TREATMENT]]. DON'T THE ACTUAL CREATORS OF THE GORILLAZ CHARACTERS REALIZE THIS!?

The true reason behind the making of the Art of Butthurt, claims Branca, is that people should have 'their own style' of drawing (like '''she''' does, but apparently Bolshakova doesn't). But, in the grand scheme of things, Branca's artwork is pretty much a shitty, crude version of the same Gorillaz style which seems to be drawn by every talentless fangirl. Not that Branca is a fangirl — 2D is Branca's man bitch, which, strictly speaking, makes ''him'' the [[gay|fangirl]] and only goes further to show that Branca is really [[batshit]] [[insane]].

===Vandalism===
[[Image:Brancaerase.jpg|thumb|Where is your [[god]] now?]]
Branca and her [[fantard|minions]] tried to erase this article from ED. As a result, it caused much [[lulz]] and chuckles o'plenty as they had obviously never heard of [[revert]]s. Then a bunch of Branca haters showed up and had some edit wars with her and her fantards, resulting in the whole article collapsing in on itself in a long horrible mess overladen with images and full of pointless warning templates. It took months for trained [[Dramatician]]s to repair the damage. And it's constantly [[Spellcheck|checked]] because even trained Dramaticians can spell poorly or make [[typo]]s sometimes.

=== Stolen Artwork on Brazilian TV ===

[[Last Thursday]], Branca found a [http://branca.deviantart.com/art/CQC-Brasil-desktop-edit-90271174 shit excuse] to submit more garbage to DevianTART because of a lame TV show from Brazil. Her childish self began to stalk the guys from CQC and kept asking them to show her artwork. Probably in a mentally impaired fog after her shitstorm, the guys at CQC actually agreed to show her art. With an ego larger than [[Texas]], Branca kept bragging about how they were going to show her work on TV for nearly two weeks; this included writing a journal in Portuguese (because no English folk give a shit) in [[ALL CAPS]]. When CQC flashed her abomination to the people of Brazil, they gave credit not to Branca but to another person, a girl nicknamed [http://www.youtube.com/user/brunamorini Bruh Morini], which was probably a mere mix-up since it was Branca who actually sent it to the studio. Branca kept depicting Bruh as "that [[bitch]]" and calling her a "thief of credit", which is a "very [[Srs|serious]] sin", even though she should consider herself lucky that they've actually shown her art on TV. In a journal sporting the [[emoticon]] of [[butthurt|OUTRAGE]], Branca tried convincing her fans that she was innocent, and acted as if Bruh Morini killed her parents. Branca also made a gif sequence of CQC showing her work, expecting that her fans would comfort her. This event raises the puzzling question: Why would someone EVER want to steal Branca's art and claim it as their own?  Really, come on now.
Since the whole case was ridiculous and Branca didn't want to look like the [[batshit insane|crazy evil bitch]] she really is, she baleeted all the [http://209.85.135.104/search?q=cache:Wt8X8yckgWsJ:branca.deviantart.com/journal/+brunavslina&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1 journals] showing the stupid screaming message she sent to Bruh Morini. Talk about netiquette.
Now she's sending crappy [http://branca.tusspot.angelfire.com/_Gorillaz/CQC_Black_suit_coming.html animations] to the CQC guys and hoping they can send her some praising emails. She also sent them a new drawing. Let's face it, when it comes to [[Stalker|stalking CQC]], Branca can be worse than Bruh Morini.

Image:Youcouldbenext.jpg|For Branca, drawing [[shitty]] [[fanart]] of [[Porn|Herself and 2D]] can be a tiring job, so instead she harasses some top deviant who doesn't even know her to draw for her. After all, SHE'S FUCKING [[GOD]], and even those who don't know her should treat as such.
Image:Brlies.jpg|[[Waaaambulance|Branca disabled comments]] because she knows very well [http://branca.deviantart.com/art/To-a-Friend-UPDATED-98844271 this] is still [[crap]]py.
Image:Sorrow2.jpg|How come she has more to say in [[Moonspeak]] than in English?
Image:Bwryyy.jpg|She looks up to her [[fan]]s only when they stop licking her [[ass]] and giving her faves. [[Bullshit|Everybody loves Branca! ^^]]
Image:Nothingbad4her.jpg|[[O RLY?]]
Image:Shesnot.gif|Would her [[Hawt|shapely legs]] be telling a [[lie]]?
Image:Bawwwb.jpg|The things [[Attention whore|she does for attention]].
Image:Bnice.jpg|She can't accept your rules, but you must accept hers, which include [[Nobody cares|her engagement with 2D]].
Image:2d2meh.jpg|She's always making people sure that [[Mary Sue|her character is married to 2D]], not her. [[LOL WUT]].
Image:Wutshewants.gif|She seems to love the word "hate" a lot.
Image:Btranslation.jpg|Why make an effort to write in English if [[Too lazy|she doesn't make any effort]] to draw or [[Photoshop|color]]?
Image:Fatbear.jpg|[[LOL WUT]]. [[Nobody cares|Who asked her]] anyway?
Image:Dontbvictm.jpg|She would make more "victms" if she stabbed [[fans]] with her pen.
Image:Scanneremo.jpg|Was [[Attention whore|she]] trying to ask for something?
Image:Blockedbranca.jpg|[[Some argue]] not everybody loves Branca. ^^ Specially when she addresses her ex-friends by their real names when they actually beg her [[over nine thousand]] times not to do that.
Image:Bnogorillaz.jpg|Branca isn't sure about leaving [[Gorillaz]], because she thinks [[Narcissistic|they're going to miss her body]].
Image:Bcoolcomics.jpg|If only her thoughts were ''humbles''...
Image:Battention.jpg|Can someone tell her the [[Nobody cares|comics]] are unintelligible not because they're [[tldr|long]], but because of the [[Engrish|poor grammar]]?
Image:Cindybranca.jpg|Yes, of course it's her [[original character]] taking the quiz. [[LOL|Not her]].
Image:Gorillaz_yay.jpg|Hallelujah!
Image:Bgodanswer.jpg|Try [[Google]] Maps, Branca.

==== The Brancaverse ====

This interactive piece of "fan art" shows a brief introduction to the concept of a [[perfect]] world for [[Mary Sue|Branca]]. After all, [[Unwarranted self importance|it's all about her pathetic self]], and not about Gorillaz. Click [http://megaswf.com/serve/44106/ here].

==== Tutorial ====

Branca's way of drawing is fucking deep, because, unlike you, she has ''speshul'' [[animu]] talents. Despite this being a complete waste of time, we will try to teach you, the artistically inferior readers, how to make a picture properly. Because Branca's way of doing things '''is''' the proper way.
<br>
WARNING: This tutorial is infected with [[homosexuality]]. Upon reading it, the disease might be transmitted to your sorry rectum.

[[Image:Branca_dramatic_tutorial.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Tutorial for dummies, featuring Branca's [[fag|hairdresser]] Kevin.]]

Of course, it would be impossible to compare this shitty tutorial to the [[Crap|flawless]] pictures made by Branca... Oh, one can only wish to reach her level sometime in the far future.

== Fucktard of all trades == 

Branca is known among ex-fans as a [[fucktard]]. Probably because [[Narcissistic personality disorder|she cares too much about herself]] and doesn't give a crap at all to people who praise her like a bunch of [[zombie]]s. She will always try to gather all the [[attention]], deal with it. 

''Note: The contributions have been sent with the pixelated halves, in order to protect the "victims", apparently.''

<gallery>
Image:Bfucktard1.jpg|Here's [[Mary Sue|Branca]], showing her happiness for having [[Fandom|people who take precious time out of their lives to play with her]] by [[photoshop]]ping the [[shit]] out of her half and [[Nice try|making it look better]]. 
Image:Bfucktard2.jpg|Branca [[Internet celebrity|loves her friends]]: she shows it by [[Attention whore|making her half larger than life]], and resizing her friends' parts and thus messing them. She should have made '''her''' half smaller.
</gallery>

== How do I get praised? ==

# Bonk a cartoon rockstar and [[marriage|castrate]] him;
# Upload some proof (including photos of your genetically defective spawn) on DeviantART;
# [[????]];
# [[Profit]]!

It is very important to add a generous portion of "giggles" during step 1 through step 3, or step 4 will be [[fail]] due to lack of cuteness and sweetness.

== Quotes from Branca ==

== BRANCA AND 2D GET A DIVORCE ==

As it turns out, Branca married another man [[IRL]] and divorced 2D.  The fact that she got laid [[IRL]] made her realize the advantages it had to have a real dick over mental [[masturbation]].  Branca has finally grown up.  [[Kawaii|D'AWW]]. However, this means no more lulz. But that doesn't mean this article won't grow. Keep sending contributions!

[[Image:Brancagotlaid2.jpg]]

There was an all-new remake of [[Nobody cares|Branca's existence in Gorillaz's lives]], excluding [[Porn|the nipples]], the depiction of Paula [[Wrong|as a raging bitch]], Murdoc and Russel [[fap]]ping at her [[Hawt|thrombosis-affected legs]] and also [[Insane|the days she almost killed 2D]]. But like many [[lolcows]], she ended up removing the vid. Maybe because she thought a real "Branca and 2D story" should indeed have all the juicy items above.

{{quote|A video I made based on my fanarts of Gorillaz. I created a char called Branca and I wanted she lived with them.|Branca - describing her "[[Porn|love]] story" on [[Youtube]].}}



Her last video was [[No|getting quite a feedback]] on Youtube:

So, she [[Nice try|changed the description]]:

*[http://www.branca.deviantart.com '''Branca's DevianTart page''']: <s>She will always "[[attention whore|thank you for the praise]]" and flirt with male deviants who watch her, but she will also have you suspended or [[Banhammer|banhammered]] if you dare to disagree.</s> Deactivated due to the lack of asslickers lately.<br>
*[http://fanines-of-branca.deviantart.com/ '''Fanines of Branca''']: A Branca fan club that was founded only because [[troll|Fernet]] entered the scene. <s>Join it and spend a lifetime drawing fanart for Branca.</s> <s>Currently taken by [[trolls]], as it seems to have been abandoned by [[fantard|those who care]].</s> Finally baleeted, just like her LinaCS account.
*[http://branca.sheezyart.com/ '''Branca's Sheezyart page''']: The place in which she used to complain about not having the same amount of pageviews that she has in DevianTart. Maybe that's why she abandoned the account.
*[http://stopthebranca.blogspot.com/ '''Stop the Branca''']: A blog by Fernet. All you wanted to know about Branca, but were too '''outrageously embarrassed''' to ask.

*[http://linacs.deviantart.com/ '''LinaCS''']: <s>Her "totally different" non-Gorillaz DevianTart account. It may not have Gorillaz, but it has a lot of [[Mary sue|Branca]]: same garbage in new package. Incidentally the [[fat]] fuck's new story involves her winning an eating contest and being rewarded with free burgers. Pure [[Emoticon|literature]].</s> Empty because Branca wanted to [[delete fucking everything|hide evidence]] that she's not only a homophobe, but also racist. Or [[some argue|maybe]] just because the [[shit|account]] wasn't receiving the same feedback she gets when she draws [[porn|2D and her]].
*[http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=IloveGorillaz '''Branca's YouTube''']: don't bother.
*[http://branca.tusspot.angelfire.com/ '''Branca's website "Mess in The House"''']: ditto.

*[http://groups.msn.com/TheGoRiLLaZFamily/noodlesarts.msnw '''The Gorillaz Family (MSN group)''']: Branca (nicknamed 'Noodle') before she became [[e-celebrity|popular]]. 2DxPaula, anyone?
