A '''church''', or orgy house, is a structure where [[Scientology|Christians]] go to be [[pwnd]] by the priests fat baptized [[cock]]. [[loli|Children]] receive special treatment as their [[anus|faith]] is still small and unstretched.  It is common knowledge that all [[paradox|churches]] are owned and run by Godzilla 2000 himself, [[John McCain]].  If you are a member, then every Sunday you will be forced to [[brb church]] (much to the [[lulz]] of those around you).

===Practice===
Proceedings in a church begin with a big Jesus loving orgy known by most [[faggot|Christians]] as Mess.  Aptly named for all of the [[cum]] and faith it leaves behind in the church. If a christian should get tired of all the [[buttsecks]], they are welcome to the alcohol and snacks provided by his in-your-holiness.  Originally Mess was a reason for people to convert, however today Mess is only attended by old men, their sluts, and their [[loli]].  For this reason, only families with [[pedophile]] fathers or faggots [[brb church]] today.  Should you see a family walking home from church on Sunday, it is common courtesy to ask them if they are [[butthurt]] from mess and if they are in need of [[murder|assistance]].

===History===
Prior to the civil war, Churches only existed in the south.  However, due to Robert E. Lee getting [[pwnd]], the [[rednecks]] decided to invade the north and built orgy houses everywhere in sight.  Now the screams of old [[republicans]] can be heard all over the country on a Sunday, much to the disgust of the rest of the world.  If another player claims to you that churches existed earlier in a place called [[fiction|Urup]], they are [[life|NPCs]] and should be ignored.

[[shit nobody cares about|Other religions also have churches]], but since those churches place much less of an emphasis on [[boylove]], [[nobody gives a shit]].
