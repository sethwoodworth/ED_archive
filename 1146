{{lj|braumsgirl26}}, aka {{lj|goldendragon26}}, {{lj|selenafan27}}, {{lj|pilotofburning}},   {{lj|kawaiifoxgirl}}, and {{lj|bscfanc}}, is either a [[troll]] or [[retard|mentally challenged]]. She haunts {{ljcomm|customers_suck}}, {{ljcomm|bad_service}}, and {{ljcomm|c_suck_snark}}, picking fights in order to show off her incredibly [[retarded|witty]] and [[fail|devastating]] insults. She is also active on AIM, Yahoo! Instant Messenger, and MSN.

Braumsgirl has four kinds of insults:
#ur [[fat]]
#u wear [[Babyfur|diapers]]
#ur a [[dog]]
#ur a [[baby]]
To be fair, this isn't much different from the arsenal of the average ED user, but Braumsgirl can be identified by the incredibly convoluted and repetitive structure of her insults. She can barely understand what she's saying, so she has to repeat herself and circle back in order to achieve full comprehension, giving her work the disjointed quality of [[Tom Cruise|schizophrenic ramblings]]. Her lack of cognitive ability, of course, leads her to believe that anything difficult for her to understand must be utter brilliance.

== What Is It? ==
In January of 2007, Braumsgirl posts to {{ljcomm|customers_suck}} about a bad experience she had at work: she was
[http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/20186391.html verbally accosted by a stranger], which made her cry, and her manager accused her of scamming for a free meal. She says she only works two hour shifts, two days a week, and has a four hour commute. Not only that, but her stepfather actually drives her out and back. The mod, {{lj|pezstar}}, starts [http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/20186391.html?thread=283321111&style=mine#t283321111  deleting comments] to freeze drama. 

Later that day, she posts a [http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/20190648.html remembered suck], wherein she has trouble waking up at 11am and cries because a manager she liked had been fired. Someone teases her about crying, to which braumsgirl26 can only say, "Mew??!" Then someone gives her a present because it is her birthday. Yay!

The weirdness gets written up on [http://community.livejournal.com/c_suck_snark/43121.html c_suck_snark], [http://community.livejournal.com/c_suck_snark/43121.html?thread=557425&style=mine#t557425 someone links her to it], and she posts [http://braumsgirl26.livejournal.com/3906.html this]:
{{squote|so theres this two year old retard lianzim74 that seems mad because while I have my two hour job and manage to get my work done and still care for my co workers.........

it is busy trying to learn to do basic things. Like act human.

I have to bust ass to not give up hope since I got stuck with a operation that was suposed to give me more years at work with those I cared for (and more hours) but it revered itself because I did too much too soon. Granted I could never work the all day everyday shifts of my managers even if things had turned out right.

And baby lianzim74 is all mad because even if it ever grows up the only job it'll be able to do is work in one of those sheltered programs.

Or maybe just doing simple tasks will be 'job' enough for it.

I can see it now.... a few years from now when lianzim74 is 30 years old now and still living with mommy and its 40 brothers and sisters cause mommy can't keep her legs closed.

lianzim74's Mama : Baby mama will give you a whole cookie if you'll get up and walk down to the corner and bring your sister home from her job.

lianzim74 : Me walk!!! *gets up sloooowwwlllyyyyy and toddles down to corner*

lianzim74's mama : good job!!!

lianzim74 : *returns 11 hours later* here sissy ma-ma! *points to inbred dog*

lianzim74's mama : No. I know I called your sister a inbred dog but..........nevermind good try.

lianzim74: Me did good! *drool*

how do you like it fucktard?|wat}}
This is, perhaps, the textbook example of her labored attempts at an insult. It's clear she worked hard, and is proud of herself for her viciousness, and yet [[TL;DR]].

== She Really Loses It ==
Just a few days later, Braumsgirl posts about how a woman threw a fit at her workplace while [http://community.livejournal.com/customers_suck/20232320.html?nc=23&style=mine she got paid to play in the playground].
{{squote|At 1pm I clocked out and once in the van I let the tears fall. Mock and Snark me all you guys want but I felt bad.

Once again, people question her story and she lets fly:
{{squote|then again maybe I should ask trinity1986 since they know everything

==Death of Braumsgirl; Enter the Dragon==
Soon afterward, she starts to [http://community.livejournal.com/fake_lj_deaths/245797.html?style=mine#cutid1 die], in standard LJ fashion. Presumably resurrected as {{lj|goldendragon26}}, she [http://goldendragon26.livejournal.com/30241.html continues to bitch] about customers_suck. She also begins to haunt the journals of Avatar_fans members, with such gems of wisdom as

{{quote|Please remove yourself from my friendslist and my life as I don't care to lower myself and associate with avatar fans. so in other words GET BENT!  |color=silver|size=360%}} 

{{quote|Nice to do list moron. Add making the world a better place by fucking the hell off to it PLEASE because YOU'RE what's wrong with the world! go rot. |color=silver|size=360%}} 

on a user named Dungeonwriter's journal. The intrepid young lady sold the story of being stalked online to a newspaper and is laughing all the way to the bank. When she mentioned this on her journal and suggested doing a follow-up, she was rewarded with this fine threat, 

only if you want to be sued as well as go to jail and have to explain to your parents why you got their net shut down |color=silver|size=360%}} 

from an anonymous source. Three guesses who it was? 

She then makes up trolling live journals such as  {{lj|pilotofburning}}


{{quote|Well as they say here goes nothing. I hope by weeks end I'll have enough to rid the net of the 'person' that keeps stalking my friends and random people all over the net. on here they go by dungeonwriter I've read some of their posts and it seems what I was told is true. they're nothing but a psycho that thinks they own the world including the net so they can do what they want. Your basic spoiled two year old brat. Only s/h/it is apparently 'grown up' they think they're some great law school student when in real life I bet they're nothing but a twelve year old trying to impress the entire 5th grade. they also love to hack people. I saw their confession to that and made sure to copy paste it into an email and send it to a friend in NYC with instructions that they're to send it to the police right away if I don't say otherwise by Tuesday. I also have the person's IP address so I can find out what ISP they use so I can report them properly. The internet isn't for people like that. |color=silver|size=360%}} 

Needless to say, Dungeonwriter is still on the net and found the entire situation hilarious, since she is a pre-law student and is quite eager to pass the bar and put people like this in mental institutions where they belong. 

{{quote|Hello
from [info]pilotofburning
I friended you so I can help gather evidence against you so the people you're harassing can finally be free of you. I've seen logs and you are too psycho to be on the net. I mean really! Since when do you have a right to get over 500 different live journal, AIM , MSN, IRC, AND YIM accounts to harass people just because they're better then you are?
Reply | Add as friend | Mark as Spam |color=silver|size=360%}} 
Dungeonwriter especially pitied the troll when she realized that

A. She is so desperate for friends that she has to friend people to stalk them 
B. This person is clearly deluded and paranoid 
C. That the insults are laughably pathetic. That's the best they can do? 
 

She then veers into actual Anti-Semitic attacks, making people wonder if she's a fake Nazi as well as a troll. The two do go together. 


 {{quote|Not letting Dragonbat2006 get me down 	[Oct. 8th, 2008|05:02 pm though every time i turn around I have to empty my PM box of spam PMs and threats from those two freaks I'm not going to let Dragonbat2006 or stupid get me down.


even though I'm having to help the 100s of people those two have hacked here and on other sites I'm not going to let them win.


I mean even though  Dragonbat2006 threatened me till I broke if off with a good friend who never did a bad deed to me and hacked my MSN accounts and caused the tragic fight between me and another friend I don't care


Dragonbat2006  is naturally stupid (a quality that Jews seem to have by default) so though she caused a fair bit of damage because she spends her day writing stupid fanfics and harassing people she overlooked the security info on my MSN so I was able to recover my name. (Only untill I get ahold of everyone and let them know my new SN and make sure she didn't upset anyone.)


So to Dragonbat2006 and the unfortunate accident known as dungeonwriter


You won't get me down! I do want you to stop your constant PM attacks of threats and spam and your IM hacking and your harassment of people just because they do the right thing and hate your guts or just because they're something better then you(easy task there)


But I won't let you get me down.



ETA : AWWWWWW MAN! I just tried to sign onto my new MSN to get my buddy list set up and it's not working! Great this means they found it and hacked it or hacked MSN itself

{{quote|
Read Stupid two's LJ enteries she's so self centered it's all Me Me Me My My My Mine Mine Mine with her and how she thinks her shit don't stink because she can string together words all by herself really burns me up! (Note to DW my two year old cousin can string words together too so you're not special unique or anything else.)


Atleast my posts touch on other people's activities and things.

DW's name from her mom is 'Hippo' God. Bet that fits in more ways then one.


It really BURNS ME UP that she thinks she and her fat family are SOOOOOOOO SPECHUL (Mis-spelling ment) because one of them gave birth! HELLO IDIOT! OTHERS GIVE BIRTH TOO !!! IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. GET A LIFE!


I don't know if DW is selfish cause she's so fat she can't see past her ass so she thinks she's the only person (or hippo) on this earth or because she was raised getting everything she wanted.
And I don't care. I just wish she'd stop causing me and my family to have bad luck.

The BRPS users laughed her off, but they shouldn't have; after all, her neighbor is a cop who [http://selenafan27.livejournal.com/3440.html has a list of IPs] from brps and is going to do...something.

==[[Gaia Online]] has BAD SERVICE==
In February of 2008, {{lj|bscfanc}} posted a sad tale to {{ljcomm|bad_service}} and {{ljcomm|gaia_online}}: Gaia Online '''would not take her fistfuls of money.'''
{{squote|Gaia sucks

Gaia sucks! They won't let me buy monthly letters from them because my phone number is in use and I live in an apartment and can only afford to donate maybe $50 or a little less a month.

Morons and this is a year after one of the mods got mad and banned me for wanting to put some of my items on a backup account they said I was doing it to avoid them. WTF? Losers.

THe mod I talked to even told me that gaia didn't want my fake money or my phone scam shit. WTF?!|bscfanc, http://community.livejournal.com/bad_service/1570116.html and http://community.livejournal.com/gaia_online/1797995.html}}
Where she gets $50/month to spend on Gaia when she only works four hours a week is anybody's guess. The better question is, who the hell spends $50/month on little hats for your avatar?

Members comment with variations on [[LOL WUT]] -- you know it's bad when other Gaia users are calling you an idiot -- and it gets posted to a snark comm [http://community.livejournal.com/c_suck_snark/366312.html here (locked)], but nothing much happens until a week later.

Then, [http://community.livejournal.com/c_suck_snark/369661.html she comes back].

At the moment this poster's identity is not yet confirmed, but since the trademark preoccupation with scat and infantilism is present, as is the inability to spell or form proper sentences, there isn't much doubt.



== 2010! A return of old Braumsgirl?! ==

February 2010.
A recent post on {{ljcomm|customers_suck}} is thought to be from old braumsie herself. 

Calling people [[baby|babies]]? Check.

Calling people [[Dog|animals]]? Check.

Calling people [[FAT|fat]]? Checkity-check.

[[BAW|Crying]] and being babied/praised by manager/co-workers? Of course!

[[Retarded|Horrible]] grammar? Check. Check. And checkkk. 


All arrows seem to be pointing at her (and that {{lj|dragonfier28}} username isn't helping). The post has already gone through three edits, a shitload of tags, a ton of[[macros]], and comment deleting has (reportedly) occurred.
