Viewall
Viewall is a [[LiveJournal]] utility. It is used by [[LJ]] employees (but not [[LJ Abuse]]) to read the [[friends only]] and private entries in a user's journal.

Use of viewall has been a source of drama when users attach [[A RAPE SPIDER|web bugs]] to their posts and then find people reading their private entries.
