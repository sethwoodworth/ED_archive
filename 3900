I Am Legend
[[Image:Iamlegend.gif|thumb|'''I am legend''', properly executed.]]

'''I Am Legend''' is a [[old meme|failed meme]] based on a line of dialogue from an ad for the movie "[http://iamlegend.warnerbros.com ''I Am Legend'']" with [[Will Smith]] who plays Dr. Jew Neville, the last black person alive on earth. 

Aaron Neville is a [[scientist]], but even he could not contain the horrible <s>man</s> woman-made, incurable [[AIDS|virus]]. Somehow immune, Neville is now the last human survivor in the remains of [[New York City]] and maybe the world. For three years, Neville has constantly sent out daily radio messages in between 24/7 spins of [[Bel-Air]], to try and find any other survivors who might be out there. No one wants to listen to him, however, because he is a black person.

== Teh Meme ==
The meme was simple (and gay). It consisted of the following:

*A. Post pictures of someone with a phone or message and says "My name is Dr. Robert Neville. I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies."<br>
*B. A la ''[[Battletoads]]'', call a [[gamestop|department store]] telling them you are Dr. Robert Neville, and are broadcasting on all AM frequencies. This is best played when done with static in the background as in the movie trailer, so be sure to record ones voice onto [http://audacity.sourceforge.net audacity] software or something and then add effects and play it into the phone for the [[lulz]].
*C. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkyT1vir_fg&feature=related DAMMIT FRED]
*D. <Anon 1>DAMMIT FRANK<br>
*D. <anon 2> STFU NUB ITS NOT FRANK ITS FRED<br>
*F. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6FVdTKg4gY I WAS SAVIN' THAT BACON.]
*A. [[????]]
*G. PROFIT!

'''Howevar''', [[B|/b/]] was not [[Battletoads|amused]] and [[DO NOT WANT|did not respond]]. Unlike the EPIC WIN that was "[[300]]." [[Anon]] came away lolling at the crappy movie instead of embracing it, proving - once again - that [[Will Smith]] sucks donkey balls and is only of relevance to Anon cos of [[Bel-Air]].

What replaced the above [[DO NOT WANT|(supposed)]] 'meme', were a few 15-minutes-of-fame mocking macros making light of the film's moar hilarious maguffins such as '''bacon''', '''Fred''', a '''crowbar''' and '''bacon'''.

Unfortunately Will Smith is a [[Scientology|scientologist]], so he will probably believe he has [[an hero|super powers]] after filming this.

== I Am Serious Business ==

<s>Though ''I Am Legend'' is an action/horror movie, there is also some serious drama scenes in the movie, like the one below:</s>

O DEER MY [[Dog|DOG]] IS SIK

As you can see, Will Smith is a [[Faggot|faggot]].

[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|Now this is a story all about how my<br>
Life got flipped turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I become the last man on Earth.<br>
<br>
In New York City born and raised<br>
In the labroom is where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool<br>
And all curin' some cancer outside of the school<br>
When a couple of vampires they were up to no good<br>
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I made one little mistake and everyone's dead<br>
I thought, "I'm movin' with my dog to my fortress shed"<br>
<br>
I was cornered by vampires that ate my dog<br>
But I was saved by a Brazilian that had immunity<br>
If anything I could say that this bitch was rare<br>
But I thought, "Nah, forget it. Yo home to my lair!"<br>
<br>
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the vampires yo holmes smell ya later<br>
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there<br>
To sit on my throne as the last man on Earth.<br>]]

===Dogs and Bacon version===
Now, this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I liked to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I was savin the bacon<br>
<br>
In west new york born and raised<br>
On the pier was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all shootin some infected inside ground zero<br>
When a couple of monsters<br>
Who were up to no good<br>
Startin makin trouble in my neighborhood<br>
my dog got in one lil fight and i got scared<br>
and said 'shit im savin that bacon'<br>
<br>
I whistled for my dog and when it came near<br>
The flesh was ripped and the fresh smell of blood was in the air<br>
If anything I can say this made my sanity get taken<br>
But I thought 'ah shit now you done it' - 'i was savin that bacon'<br>
<br>
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the Heavens 'Let me tell you about god's plan'<br>
I looked at my shithole, I was finally there<br>
To sit on all alone with the bacon frying in a pan<br>


'''WHY I SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN BEL-AIR'''

Now this is a story all about how<br>
My life got flipped turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you why I should have stayed in a town called Bel-Air<br>

In [[New York City]] born and raised<br>
Talkin' to mannequins is how I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool<br>
Rentin' movies and hittin' on mannequins too<br>
When a couple of [[Brian Peppers|mutants]] they were up to no good<br>
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I made one little mistake now I'm stuck in a snare<br>
I thought, ' FUCK HOW DID FRANK GET OUT THERE.'<br>

I whistled for my stupid dog Sam and when she came near<br>
I told that bitch to stop barking if she wanted some bacon<br>
If anything I would say that this dog was rare<br>
But I thought, 'Man forget it, let's get back to the lair!'<br>

I crawled up to my house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to that <s>Mexican</s> [[Brazil|Brazilian]] bitch ' Yo holmes I was savin' that bacon! '<br>
Looked outside, the mutants were finally there.<br>
To fuck up my throne, I should have stayed in Bel-Air!<br>

'''[[TL;DR]]'''

==Trolling==
A good way to [[troll]] [[faggots]] is to call the [[fleshlight|mannequin]] Neville was [[gay]] for "Frank" instead of "Fred". For some reason people get really [[butthurt]] over this.
