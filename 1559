[http://christianforums.com '''Christian Forums'''] is an internet community established [[at least 100]] years ago by a group of [[obese]] fundamentalist Christians. The forum was created due to the rapid increase of [[failure|obesity]]. Not surprisingly [[Creationism|Christians]] took up about 90% of the obesity growth and were now too fat and lazy to go to [[Hell|Church]]. Their arch enemy is [http://fstdt.net/ '''Fundies Say The Darndest Things'''], whose members regularly infiltrate the forums and submit posts by roaming fundies. Incredibly, most of CF's members are quite reasonable compared to those of [[Teens-4-christ|Teens-4-Christ]] and Theology Online.

==Forum Description==

The forum consists of many sub-forums for various topics such as [[music]], [[Jesus]], and [[pedo|Pedophilia]]. At any given sub-forum you will find various threads on topics such as:

# Why [[Muslims]] are a threat to America.
# [[Evolution]]: a lie from the [[Hillary_Clinton|devil]].
# [[Nazi|HELP 80 PERCENT OF AMERICA IS BEING OPPRESSED!]]
# [[Homosexuality]]: my personal struggle with my [[anal]] desires.
# [[Feminism]] is destroying family values.
# I had an [[sex|erotic]] dream involving my [[Tori Sue Heck|ex-girlfriend]]. Am I committing [[adultery]]?
# [[Atheist]]s have no [[God]] therefore they have no morals.
# I had a dream involving a big scary [[gay|closet monster]], obviously I'm being attacked by [[Satan]].
# I'm addicted to [[masturbation]], please [[trepanation|help]] me!
# I felt turned on by a female on television.  Is this a sin?
# Even though science disproves everything about religion, I told my atheist neighbour she is going to hell!

The list can go on forever.

==Drama==

CF is known for bawling over pointless issues. [[Last Thursday]], the CF admin decided to allow non-Christians to access the [[KKK|Christian]] only sections on the forum. In return several [[butthurt]] conservative Christian members made threads telling non-Christians to [[GTFO]]. But this was only half of it, the CF admin really wanted to piss everyone off and change the forums name to foru.ms. When asked why he did it, his response was: "I did it for the [[lulz]]", resulting in endless complaining and harassment by fully half the entire membership over the removal of "Christian" from the domain name.

[[image:Sewer_of_Sin_and_Filth.png|thumb|right|Yes, we know America is a cesspool of corruption and sin.]]

After several months of Christians being pissed off, Jesus (admin of [[Earth]]), made a brief covert return and subsequently banned the CF admin, replacing him with a more efficient admin: Bro. Randy. As soon as Bro. Randy took control, his first move was to change the name back to ChristianForums. Hilariously, this resulted in even [[moar]] lulz.

The forum also enables you to sport a CF character, a shitty rip-off of [[Gaia Online]] in the form of badly drawn, creepy pixelated characters that look like they've been drawn by a team of visually impaired chimpanzees. But even that's not enough, you can also have even worse-looking CF pets. To acquire these monstrosities you pay for them with a currency of "blessings".

In May 2008, the bosses took CF down for a few days. When it came back up, it was something completely different - CF had gotten an overhaul. Immediately the forum became divided into two factions: the older, fundamentalist members being dramatically overprotective of the younger members; and the younger but more intelligently-sound members who pissed and complained endlessly over the fact that CF Teens was no longer open to non-Christians (among other things), something the fundies praised over and over. However, this decision was quickly reversed when the bosses realized that with even some of the admins taking the side of the CF Teens patrons, a successful coup could be managed. The fight was over almost before it truly began.

Just when you thought CF got kicked off to a good start this year, it didn't. The site's [[idiot|sharp and well minded]] advisers decided to troll the boards by decreasing the maximum age limit on the youth boards restricting its [[pedophiles|older members]] from accessing the boards and cramming them into trains sending them to other areas of CF. In response the butthurt CF youths flamed the advisers resulting in a clusterfuck of [[banhammer|banhammers]]. Out of all this, a website claiming to be the [[jews|exiles]] of CF teens was formed by an internet superhero trio (a Wiccan chick, a snake lady, and some random guy).  In response the CF administration has declared a State of Blasphemy and stated all those who leave CF are traitors and are condemned to eternal hell.

==Notable Members==

[[Image:Suecianus.JPG|thumb|right|Zeth: yesterday's Inquisitor today!]]

'''ShieldOFaith''' is as batshit as they can get, ShieldofFaith or SOF (Stubborn Obnoxious Fundie) has earned his notoriety with his unhealthy obsession with declaring "Smackdown" on homosexuals and nonbelievers in every thread he produces. He believes in the use of ''thought police''. He also awaits the [[Rapture]] and destruction of humanity by God's hand with morbid glee. You'll be waiting for a while there, Shield.

'''Renton''' evidently has never heard the term "Judge not lest ye be judged". Nowhere near as insane as ShieldofFaith or MandM, but still holds enough venom towards the non-believers that it's noticeable.

'''Autumnleaf''' likes to not-so-discreetly make threads poking at homosexuals and liberals. He will often ask dumbass, patronizing questions in his topic to look somewhat intelligent only to realize mere moments later that he's failing miserably.

'''PaladinGirl''' is very indecisive about her faith. One week she was Mormon, another week she was a JW, then Catholic, then Pentecostal, then Baptist, then Catholic again, then Baptist AGAIN, then Catholic AGAIN, and now she's Pentecostal, AGAIN, all while her icon says she's Pagan. Very sheltered, and not too bright. The perfect example of a sheep.

'''AV1611VET''' is a [[creationist]] [[fundie]], frequently featured on FSTDT. His hobbies include [[bible]] thumping and telling [[science]] to [[GTFO|take a hike]], along with happily parading his appalling ignorance and stupidity. He is also notable for making [[retarded]] "challenges" on the creation/[[evolution]] subforum. [[No life|He has an insane amount of posts (something like 1.4 million).]]

'''[[Carico]]'''. Enough said.

'''mrguitar''' totally abhors all things secular, especially music that doesn't [[ego|praise God]]. That's right. He plainly states that a song about how utterly beautiful the earth (which is God's own creation according to standard Christian beliefs, making him all the more [[stupid|odd]]) can be is [[Satan|literally UNHOLY]] and must be avoided at all costs, and then proceeds to back up his claims with the arrogant belief that God totally agrees with him 100%.

'''HotRhymez''' is a [[retard|sub-human]] wigger boner who has the deluded idea he grew up in Compton. In any given thread you will see him ranting about everyone hating him or how he keeps it gangsta "twenty fo seven". He has been banned on several occasions for persistent (and incidentally [[unfunny]]) trolling and when this happens, makes several sock accounts and claims it is not him but couldn't make it more obvious.

'''Zealous Zeth''' is a perpetually angry Swedish member formerly known as ScarletCrusader and, more recently, Sueci[[anus]]. Zeth carries the reputation as one of the most lulziest member of Christian Forums. The reason for this is because [[shit nobody cares about| no one can take him seriously]]. He is a fairly prominent super-[[Catholic]] who has [[sex|sexual]] fantasies about the [[Crusades]] and gets a [[penis|boner]] every time he dreams about Crusades happening in the future. Has the complete mentality of someone from the Dark Ages or whatever time period in which the Crusades happened. Is a profound hypocrite with extremist views and firmly believes fundamentalists are exclusively Protestant, yet he is a living contradiction of that very notion. Believes that all Americans are stupid and lurks FSTDT more than he should. Mugabe is his great [[idol]] who is only "enforcing Godly principles on his people". Catholic priests trend to [[pedophile|lick]] their lips when staring at Zeth's long blonde hair.

'''GarryDW''' was once a proud Anglican and, despite more than overwhelming evidence, refused to accept the fact that his girlfriend at the time was blatantly cheating on him. [[lulz|She then ended the relationship rather quickly]] after mysteriously finding the thread in question, sending our young Garry into a fit of emo-esque despair and self-loathing (more-so). He became a non-Christian straight afterwords, presumably because "God stole my girlfriend, I loved her, WHY DID YOU TAKE MY GIRL AWAY FROM ME BAWWWWWWWWW".

'''Tanakh''' carries three of the worst possible human traits known to man: he's an [[America|American]], he's a Jew, and he's a fundie. He has openly declared violent war on homosexuals, and is more than willing to behead one on the sidewalk outside his house in the name of ancient Israel regardless of any spectators. He will not allow anyone who is a sinner to live, but fails to realize that this includes him and thus requires suicide on his part. Supports Old Testament (Jew name: Torah) punishments such as stoning, and is apparently prepared to play the part of vigilante and prosecute (read: execute) anyone he deems to be an affront to the Torah regardless of any consequences to himself and whether it is against the law or not. In other words, he's a wannabe cop that doesn't believe in second chances or letting the REAL COPS do their job. A perfect example of a non-Christian fundie.

==Notable Threads==

[[Image:TypicalCFTEENSthreadlist.JPG|thumb|right|A typical day on the CF forums; note the attention whoring and hilarious spelling errors.]]

===[http://christianforums.com/showthread.php?t=7068797 I am so angry and upset]===
GarryDW is upset because he accidentally comes across his [[16 year old girl|girlfriend's]] [[Bebo]] page only to find that she and a mystery man named Titch have been [[cybersex|exchanging suspiciously romantic comments]] as recently as two hours beforehand. He questions whether to talk to her about it, but decides not to after being advised to do so. Soon after, his girlfriend just so happens to "randomly" find the thread in question on the internet ''(one in a million chance, really)'' and promptly dumps him, causing him to go into a fit of rage and sadness, buying her excuse that she doesn't want to be with someone who doesn't trust her. Gets all pissy and uptight when members tell him repeatedly that she was most likely using this as an excuse to break up with him for "Titch", even though the evidence strongly supports their assertions. Accuses CFT of being "all pathetic, uncaring people" thereafter. Still believes that she wasn't cheating on him and that he was a horrible, undeserving person for questioning his [[slut|girlfriend's]] credibility in the first place. Note: Scoured the entire thread late into the drama and wiped every post he made.

==Repressed Faggotry==
Anybody who lurks on Christian Forums for any length of time will notice they all seem to have a morbid obsession with [[homosexuality]] - regardless of whether they [[buttsecks|like gay people]] or [[buttsecks|believe they are the spawn of Satan]]. [[At least 100]] threads in each section and sub-section can be found talking about their not-so-secret desires to piss off the Almighty.

[[Some argue]] that [[Psychiatry|religious persecution threatens our natural sexuality, thus causing it to pop up at inappropriate moments]] - such as Christians chat rooms. Others suggest [[IDIFTL|they do it to piss-off Christfags]].
