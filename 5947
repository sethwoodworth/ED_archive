'''OH NO YOU DIDN'T''' is <strike> a fairly lulzy mini-[[meme]] burning up the Internets [[atm]]</strike> only found funny by people who haven't had the misfortune of experiencing [[fags|Ben Folds]] and [[Smegma|Richard Cheese]] doing exactly the same thing [[at least 100 years ago]]. The song is from an ad by [[EA]] for their new game ''[[Mercenaries 2]]'' and features a gangsta '[[rap]]' song sung  by some dude who's obviously white and edumacated (he doesn't rap like he's a [[wigger]]) with a simple piano backing track.

The short, 30 second version [[I CAME|exploded]] all over [[YouTube]] and the *[[chans]] like [[rap|bombs on Hiroshima]]. [[EA]] caught on quickly and [[Anon delivers|delivered like Anon]], to Anon, by releasing a 'making of the game' video with the full version of the song. They also made it available to download for free [http://www.pandemicstudios.com/mercenaries/images/downloads_bg.jpg on the game's site here].

Currently, '''Oh No You Didn't''' as a [[meme]] isn't much of anything, consisting largely of [[combo]]s of the song's lyrics. Howevar, some [[shoops]] and a smattering of [[original content]] appears to be rising to the occasion albeit, [[slowpoke|painfully slowly.]]

[[Some argue]] that not only is '''''Merc 2''''' a shit game, but the song is shit too, whilst others love the song but hate [[the game]]. Love it or hate it though, [[niggery|this bitch is finna be stuck up in your dome for a hella long time playbuoy]].

Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no! (Yo yo yo)

Oh no you didn't!
Sucka tried to play me, but you never payed me, never!
Oh no you didn't!
Payback is a coming, you will be running, forever!
Oh no you didn't!
Until I get my vengeance, I will never end this mayhem!
Oh no you didn't!
I'm a mercenary, you ain't got a prayer, you owe me!
Oh no you didn't!

(Chorus)
Oh no you didn't! (4x)
Didn't you, Oh no!
You didn't pay me what you owe me...
So now it's over for you!

(Yo yo, check it out)
Oh no you didn't!
First you tried to trap me, then you bust a cap in my ass!
Oh no you didn't!
Such humiliation will bring annihilation, at last!
Oh no you didn't!
It will be delicious, when I get vicious, tomorrow!
Oh no you didn't!
There's no second chances, you will do the dance of sorrow!
Oh no you didn't!

(Chorus)

(Alright, come on)
Oh no you didn't!
Better watch your back boy, keep running
This ain't just a game, I'll never stop coming
I got my arsenal
I put out the call
And when I finish ya'll
You'll be a ragdoll

Fool tried to diss me, now you're gonna wish you were dead!
Oh no you didn't!
After I deliver, your blood will be a river of red!
Oh no you didn't!
Better beware, when no one's there to defend you!
Oh no you didn't!
So many ways to kill, it's gonna be a thrill to end you!
Oh no you didn't!

(Chorus)

Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no you...

==Mercenaries 2: World in Flames== 

This is [[DO NOT WANT|an explosive open-world action game set in a massive, highly reactive, war-torn world. A power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns the country into a warzone.]]

Warning : This game is filled with fail on the PC. Bugged out the ass, terrible controls, button prompts fail to distinguish between console buttons and keyboard keys. Thus making this game probably one of the biggest cock gobbling worst times a gamer will ever experience.

[[Shit nobody cares about|But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. ''Mercenaries 2''â„¢ features a slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work. Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This is your kind of environment.]]
