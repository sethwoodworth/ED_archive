Pun Raccoon
[[File:Pun Raccoon Ice Creamed.jpg|thumb|right|300px|No pun intended.]]
'''Pun Raccoon''', or often just '''Pun Coon''', is yet another [[shit|glorious]] [[Advice Dog]] variant. The image depicts ''(<nowiki>*drum roll*...</nowiki>)'' a raccoon face in the center and the text surrounding it is usually some god awful pun that you'd commonly find on one of those bullshit American sitcoms like the [[Seinfeld]] show or something.
