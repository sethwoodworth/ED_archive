HA HA HA, OH WOW

[[Image:HA HA HA, OH WOW.jpg|center|500px]]

A popular [[image macro]] based on panel taken from a ''[[Belgium|Tintin]]'' comic. Perhaps the only time that anything ''Tintin''-related has ever been entertaining, except perhaps for the super-sophisticated graphic novel ''Tintin Civilizes the [[Black|Darkies]]'', and [[sceptre|a certain lol-cow]]. Useful when someone divides faggotry by zero OTI.

==USE IRL==
[[16-year-old girls]] have been defacing the name of this particular meme on IM ever since [[last Thursday|the beginning of the internets]]. People often use the phrase [[IRL]] just for the sake of using the phrase [[IRL]].
The phrase is also often used by brown/indian [[Douchebag|gangsters]], [[over 9000]] times an hour.

==USE in IM==
The typical use of the phrase in an IM conversation:


Sistafriend123: s0 th3n i wuz all lyk3 "nu-uh sistafriend"

Brotherpal456: hahahaha, '''oh wow'''.


*''Note that the above is purely a '''fictional''' conversation. Any reference to persons, living or dead, is a coincidence, and not done intentionally by the ED user (then again, it would not be at all surprising if it was.)''
