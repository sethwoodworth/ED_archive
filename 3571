[[Last Thursday]] brother '''Snoop Dogg''' aka '''Snitch Bitch''' needed some [[money]] to get cornbread and [[fried chicken]] so he rolled up into [[norton|symantec]] and started [[rap|rapping]] about how [[:File:USNEWSHACKERSCOMPUTERSBOMBS.jpg|hackers can turn your computer into a bomb]], offering the undying rewards of [[hookers and blow|fame and glory]] to anyone who does [[marketing|the same]].  Apart from being motivated by [[whores|hookers]] and [[blow]], it seems that he thought earlier [[shit nobody cares about|rap on the topic of tech]], like "[[Don't Copy That Floppy]]", was [[srsly|serious]] rather than actually being a [[Eminem|Slim Shady]] deal.  [[Stoner|'Snoopy']] believes he is a certified [[gangsta|gansta]] with many [[Genius|credentials]] to rap about anything and everything, sadly [[truth|it will just get him more whores and milkshakes anyways]]. Rumor has it that a brief stint in [[shit|folk music]] is next in [[happy negro|Snoop Doggs]] busy schedule, although secrecy is the name of [[the game]], hence the clever disguise.

This is indeed a textbook example of [[nigras]] trying to be [[white]] and sure enough has prompted a shitstorm of [[fail]] [[internet tough guys]], not excluding [[wiggers]] and [[azns]], following their [[unrealistic expectations|dreams]] of getting [[nobody gives a shit|discovered]] by [[nobody|a big time rap label]] and [[die|retiring]] [[now|early]] as a [[rich and beautiful]] [[who|somebody]] with [[unlimited disposable income]].  All videos need to be ripped and stored away in a time capsule so that future generations will know what prompted the coming [[holocaust|apocalypse]].  There also should be a [[Rule 34|rule]] against being half [[noodz|naked]] in the competition, though the lack of such rules leads some to believe that Snoop Dogg may [[faggot|be in the closet]].
