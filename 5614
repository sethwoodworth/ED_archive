*{{quote|Mämmi is now a meme.

Mämmi (pronounced ['mæm.mi] in IPA) is a Finnish traditional Easter dessert, a malt porridge which is baked in an oven. It is made of water, malt and rye flour and is dark brown in appearance. The Swedish name for it is memma.|[[Anonymous]]}}

Naturally Mämmi was not a meme... yet. Within seconds [[Anonymous|Anonymous]] let loose an undeniable tsunami of scat porn coupled with the original quote.

==How To Mämmi==
Basically just paste the original quote into your image-board of choice, along with a horrendous scat picture. Lulz ensues!
