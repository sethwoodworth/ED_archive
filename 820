I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights down, in the middle of a scene. Then why the fuck are you walking right through? [[Lol wut|A-ta-da ta-ra]], like this in the background. [[Wtf|What the fuck]] is it with [[you]]?]]

'''Bale Out''' or the '''Christian Bale Ragefit''' refers to one of the greatest moments in cinematographical history.

The recipe for a Bale Out is to mix [[rage]] and [[self-pwn]] in equal parts. 

The story broke when a video was posted on [[YouTube|a certain video site]], containing an audio tape of [[Christian Bale|the goddamn Batman]] shouting [[Tourettes|random swear words]] at an on-set worker who decided to walk on the set during the filming of a scene. 

Hilarity ensued. Well, for about 30 minutes. 31 minutes later YouTube was full of retarded remixes of Bale's unique brand of anger management.

== The Bale Bomb ==

It all went down during the filming of "[[Terminator]] Salvation" in [[New Mexico]], when some guy, [[shit nobody cares about|supposedly the cinematographer]], walked onto the set and unwittingly detonated the Bale Bomb. 

The innocent [[retard]] tried to [[Pussy|apologise]], but by this point [[VTEC Just Kicked In Yo|Bale had built up a full head of steam]] and was running on momentum. The screaming continues, with Bale threatening to quit the movie unless the hapless prole is fired.

Eventually Bale's meds kick back in, and the return to normality is signaled by the words "Fuckin' ass."

Bale Out by Lucian Piane, the least shitty of the funny internet videos which came in the wake of Bale's headsplosion, was chiefly responsible for naming the meme. The artist himself later explained his [[For the lulz|motives]], probably out of sheer physical fear that Bale would track him down and give him his pelvis to wear as a hat.

=== Aftermath ===

Soon afterwards, Mr. Bale came down with [[Troll's remorse]] and apologized to the unfortunate henchman in numerous interviews for the "[[LOL WUT|Misunderstanding.]]" It was not reported whether Christian Bale himself has heard any of the remixes, but seeing as how California is still there and not a smoking crater, we can probably assume not.

[[Some Argue|Some may say]] that Christian was being possessed by [http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/02/12/2010-02-12_new_mexico_house_christian_bale_rented_while_filming_terminator_had_dead_body_in.html the angry spirit of the dead body in his rental house] while he was filming the Terminator movie, which turned out to be the ex-husband of the home's landlord. Truly, you cannot make shit like this up - of all the places to rent in [[New Mexico|Albuquerque]] to a fairly popular acting cunt, [[LOL|he gets the one house with a corpse in the garden for eight years]].
