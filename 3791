'''[[hugbox|Huggle]]''', along with [[twink]]le, is [[TOW]]'s main way of getting rid of the massive, massive amounts of [[vandalism]] from [[13-year-old boy]]s across the [[world|globe]], but mainly in the developed world, because [[the child in Africa]] actually wants to play on the streets instead. The program loads up a [[recent changes patrol|recent changes]] feed, and the [[slave]] to the wiki who partakes in this form of [[BDSM|humiliation]] is taunted with [[profanity]], [[nonsense]], [[threats of violence]], [[memes]] and [[spam]] with the occasional [[cocksucking|good faith edit]] slipping in. The Huggle user is then given a choice whether to let the edit slip by or to revert it as vandalism. Most [[Wikipedo]]s who use Huggle only do so so that they can up their edit count, to improve their [[unrealistic expectations|hope]] of becoming a [[sysop]]. They also actually like blatant vandalism of Wikipedia because it means that they have more edits when they revert it, and they often try to beat [[ClueBot]] to the job whilst [[faggotry|huggling]]. If they are unsure whether something is [[AGF|vandalism or not]], they will not revert it because they care more about their wiki-reputation than the [[encyclopedia]] itself and we all know that potential [[Wikipedia admin]]s are expected to be [[lie|perfect]].

People who have used Huggle are numerous. [[Sceptre]] used to use it before he had his rollback denied by MBisanz, and [[Urban Rose]] did too before she realised that editing Wikipedia is a completely pointless fucking waste of your time, because what's fun about [[no original research|re-wording what others say]] when you can [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|write whatever you fucking feel like and laugh at it]] and the people who are [[offended]] by it?

Like Twinkle, Huggle has a [[gay]] name. It is thought that anti-vandalism [[tool]]s being named after gay [[bear]]s and [[twink]]s hugging each other whilst having [[buttsecks]] is a deliberate form of humiliation developed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] who secretly [[fetish|get off]] on the fact that these losers are [[totalitarian state|brainwashed fucking slaves]] to the [[dogma]] spewed out of [[Jimbo Wales]]' mouth (although he always gets someone smarter than him to write his public announcements).

To pretend you are using Huggle while vandalizing, add "([[vandal|HG]])" at the end of your edit summary.
