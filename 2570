Earrape
[[Image:Windowlicker.png|thumb|250px|right|Spectral analysis of earrape.]]
'''Earrape''' is shorthand for painfully loud music and/or noise broadcast into the speakers (or preferably headphones) of unsuspecting [[noob|people]] somewhere across the vastness of the [[internets]]. Earrape is a common, time-tested [[trolling]] tactic on [[Ventrilo]]/[[Teamspeak]] and voicechat-enabled games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Second Life]]'', and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''.

==Types of earrape==
*'''3,500 Hz square wave''': A synthesized tone that corresponds to the most sensitive range of human hearing.  Hurts like hell, even if the volume's not so loud.  Popularized by the [[You Forgot Poland]] (Vote 5) fad on [[YTMND]].

[[Image:Ventrilo-menu-setup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|PUMP UP THE VOLUME]]
*'''Amplified Output''': Another effective way to rape ears is to max out your output amplifier setting.  This will turn every sound that comes out of your microphone (or line in, or whatever) into ear-shattering cacophony.

*'''Microphone Feedback''': Perhaps the simplest way to generate ear rape.
:# Place microphone near speaker (or under headphones).
:# Turn up volume.
:# Press "TALK".
:# EARRAPE!

==Ear Rape 2.0: Annoying as Fuck==

[[Image:Earsex.jpg|thumb|[[doing it wrong|Wrong ear rape]].]]
Just as the [[Pain series]] and [[Goatse]] might lead you to [[eye bleach]], every now and then some sound will come along that is so painful it will make [[you]] want to thrust a screwdriver into your ears.

[[Some argue|Certain people claim]] that even the ultra-popular [[Chocolate rain]] should be on this list, but including a [[meme]] of such importance would cause an absolute uproar among [[trolls]]. Indeed, all of these videos have thousands if not millions of views, sadly demonstrating the average [[IQ]] of the common [[YouTube]] user.

===Crazy Frog===
[[Image:Crazy Frog UNwiki.PNG|thumb|250px|Yes, it really is that bad.]]
All the way back in [[2005]], this clip quickly became infamous among a few people with [[ADHD|short attention spans]] around the globe. It features a frog with bad teeth, bulging eyes and [[goggles]] riding an invisible motorcycle and flashing his small, shrivelled [[dick]].

[[Chav]]s were particularly fond of Crazy Frog; as a popular [[ringtone]], it was advertised every 5 minutes on [[MTV]], attracting their fellow [[wanker|hipsters]] from every corner of the country.

===Gummy Bear===
Just like Crazy Frog, Gummy Bear is crappy [[advertising|viral marketing]], featuring a soundtrack at the lowest end of [[Euro]]-[[techno]] and a CG character that does the right things to make [[retards|internet n00bs]] [[piss]] themselves laughing over the water cooler at the office the day after they see it.
