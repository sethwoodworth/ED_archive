A [[hardvice]] [[troll|troll account]].  

From April 10 to April 25, 2005, [[hardvice]] had to use {{lj|user=poko_fister}} as his main account while his [[DMCA]] counternotification was pending against {{lj|user=twinklinlilstar}}, [[Owen ray pugface|Owen Ray Pugface]]'s mother.  Months after the original {{ljcomm|user=nouglybabies}} drama, hardvice posted the photoshop of Owen and [[ohbutyouwillpet]] in a comment thread to an [http://www.livejournal.com/users/hardvice/200664.html unrelated post].  Little Owen's overzealous mama [[Internet stalking|somehow found out]] and filed a DMCA complaint.  

Hardvice filed a counternotification and asked [[LJ Abuse]] to suspend his account for fourteen days while the complaint was pending rather than delete the comment.  Twinklinlilstar's pals and [[sock puppet]]s showed up in Poko_fister's journal to [http://www.livejournal.com/users/poko_fister/751.html stir up some drama], but succeeded only in revealing Twinklinlilstar's long-forgotten identity&mdash;at which point she deleted all visible content from her [[jernal]].

On April 25, when Twinklinlilstar had failed to file suit within the period prescribed by the DMCA, [[LJ Abuse]] restored [[Hardvice]]'s [[jernal]] and [http://www.livejournal.com/users/poko_fister/6216.html granted him permission to use the image to his heart's content].  He promptly made it his default [[user picture]] until a shinier object came along.
