'''Gazarooster''', aka Richard the Rooster, Rooster Bob, or GAZACOCK, is the sekrit leader of the terrorist group [[Hamas]].  He - along with  3,465,463 of his fellow Arabs - is known to disorientate lu[[r9k]]ing insomniacs who [[sick fuck|enjoy watching people die live via the Internets]]; call in suicide attacks on [[Israel]]i forces, and bone camels six ways from Sunday. He may often be heard (but not seen) among the sounds of ALLLLLAHHHHHHUUU AKKKKKBARRRRRR, [[WTC|Jewplanes]], and gunfire. 

Note: Gazacock ate the dog. 
This [[Meme]] supposedly comes from a [[Stickam]] user named Cypher after the watchers started talking about the rooster. Cypher is known as GazaCam and GazaLive, Where Gazarooster has a live performance every now and then.
