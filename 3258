Ever wondered why a rainbow is the [[gay]] symbol? Is it because it shows that [[God]] still [[God hates fags|loves them]]? Is it a reflection of their colorful characters? Or is it because the rainbow is the universal signal of [[Obama|hope]]?

'''No.''' In actuality the rainbow is a reflection of the wide variety of colours used to prove just how [[perverted]] these [[Blow job|cum-sucking]], [[Rim job|shit-licking]] [[Ram job|ass-rammers]] really are. Enter the '''gay hanky code'''.


== A Magical Guide to Hankies ==
<Center>{{bigpic|Gay hanky code.PNG|600|300|An extensive and oddly specific guide.}}</center>

=== The Left-Right Distinction ===
If the hanky is worn on the '''left''', the wearer wants '''to give it'''. In other words, he is a brutal, sadistic [[rapist]] who will merrily tear your ass open while [[you]] scream and [[cry]] for [[more|mercy]]. (See ''[[Sick Fuck]]''.)

If the hanky is worn on the '''right''', the wearer wants '''to take it'''. In other words, he is a masochistic [[pussy]] who gets his [[rocks]] off by being [[ravished]] violently and subsequently developing a [[victim complex]]. (See ''[[Attention Whore]]''.)

=== Non-Colors ===

Not all of the code relies on handkerchiefs.

* '''Fur''' - Into [[Beastiality|fucking]]/[[Beastiality|being fucked by]] [[animals]]. [[Ironic]] that the [[animals]] they "love" so much need to die to facillitate their horrifying [[fetishes]].
* '''Kewpie Doll''' - Is/seeks a [[pedophile]].
* '''Union Jack''' - Is/seeks a [[skinhead]]; has no use for the "race" hankies.
* '''Ziploc Bag''' - Has/wants [[drugs]].

=== Race ===

Still [[Great Black Dick Hoax|stupid enough to believe that blacks have huge cocks]]? Well, for all the [[racist]] faggots out there, there is a guide that will help you choose which color you would like to [[In the ass|ass]][[fuck]]/get assfucked by tonight:

* '''Black & White Stripes'''' - Likes the [[darkies]]
* '''White Lace''' - [[DAMN NIGGA]]
* '''Yellow & White Stripes''' - Likes [[Asians]]

=== [[Rape]] ===

{{squote|He was asking for it, Your Honor! He was wearing a blue handkerchief!| [[Bubba]]}}

A little-known fact about hankies is that they can make [[rape]] [[I did it for the lulz|perfectly legal]].

Since there are so many legitimate reasons to rape, the blue hanky is rarely needed. However, if the little queeny twat is being difficult, make sure to [[fuck]] him senseless and plant a blue hanky on him afterwards.

== A Hoax? ==

There has been much debate around whether the so-called "Hanky Code" was in fact, [[real]].

[[Nobody|Who]] cares?

It's not as though whether something is [[true]] or not has ever stopped an [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[article]] before.

== [[Christian]] Hanky Code ==

[[Image:Bushrainbow.jpg|thumb|300px| Sometimes [[doing it wrong]] is the same as doing it right. Even if it is [[George Bush]].]]

[http://www.postfun.com/pfp/features/97/august/hankies.html Is this a joke?] Do we dare to think this might actually be true? If it isn't, it might as well be, as most Christians are in-the-closet [[cockmongler]]s anyway.

== Other Gay Symbols ==

Now that the essential distinction between masculine, dominant [[heterosexual]] [[man]] and feminine, submissive [[heterosexual]] [[woman]] has begun to fade thanks to [[Leftard]] [[Feminists|Womens' Studies]] majors, we need a whole new set of symbols to properly describe a person's gender, sex and sexual preferences:

=== The Rainbow ===

Now that you know the true origins of the the [[Gay]] Rainbow, let's clear up a few lingering myths:

[[Image:Rainbow_USA.gif|thumb|200px|WHITE = [[cum]].]]

'''<u>[[Myth|The Myth]]</u>:'''

# '''<font color=Red>RED</font>''' = [[Life]]
# '''<font color=Orange>ORANGE</font>''' = Healing
# '''<font color=Yellow>YELLOW</font>''' = Sun
# '''<font color=Green>GREEN</font>''' = Nature
# '''<font color=Blue>BLUE</font>''' = [[Art]]
# '''<font color=Indigo>INDIGO</font>''' = Harmony
# '''<font color=Purple>VIOLET</font>''' = Spirit


'''<u>[[Truth|The Truth]]</u>:'''

# '''<font color=Red>RED</font>''' = [[Fisting|Fister]]/[[Fisting|Fistee]]
# '''<font color=Orange>ORANGE</font>''' = Filthy [[slut]] (anything goes)
# '''<font color=Yellow>YELLOW</font>''' = [[Piss]]er/[[Piss]]ee
# '''<font color=Green>GREEN</font>''' = [[Prostitute]]/[[Elliot Spitzer|John]]
# '''<font color=Blue>BLUE</font>''' = Wants/Gives [[blowjobs]]
# '''<font color=Indigo>INDIGO</font>''' = Gives/Takes it [[in the ass]]
# '''<font color=Purple>VIOLET</font>''' = [[Piercing|Piercer]]/[[Piercing|Piercee]]

=== Pink Triangle ===

The '''<font color=pink>pink triangle</font>''' is a hilariously [[ironic]] symbol of the [[gay]] movement. [http://www.aaronsgayinfo.com/Fsymbols.html According to Aaron (who is apparently qualified to provide "Gay Info")], "the pink triangle, or ''Rosawinkel'' in [[German]], was sewn onto the clothes of homosexuals sent to [[concentration camps]]" -- then later became a symbol of gay solidarity. [[Seriously]].

[[Image:Pink_triangle.jpg|thumb|200px|Unlike the [[cocks]] of most gay men, this one is in the middle of a [[cunt|big black box]]. No sharp Edges, Even [[moar]] gay.]]

=== Victory Over [[AIDS]] ===
[[Image:RainbowAIDS.gif|thumb|left|200px|Moar than a touch of [[irony]].]]

This symbol is a prime example of [[FAIL]] for one important reason:

<center><big>Gays have '''not''' triumphed over '''<font color="red">AIDS</font>'''.</big></center>

It only wins in that [[black]] is pushed to the bottom -- just like it should be.
