[[image:conspiracy.jpg|thumb|right|Admins deleted WTC]]'''m''' stands for [[CP|minor]] edit. By clicking the check box next to "This is a minor edit", [[you|one]] would think that this would deter the [[admin]]s from deleting the [[shit nobody cares about]] you just created or inserted into an article. This is not the case, as nobody, repeat '''NOBODY''', actually hides minor edits. It actually helps them to track down and delete said shit, as it's extremely easy to notice a bold '''m''', especially when it's sitting right next to an '''[[ALLCAPS]] BOLD N'''.
