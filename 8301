{{squote|'''The Secret''' reveals the most powerful law in the universe. The knowledge of this law has run like a [[Piss|golden thread]] through the lives and the teachings of all the prophets, seers, sages and saviors in the world's history, and through the lives of all truly great men and women.|[[Batshit insane|Rhonda Byrne]]|priming for [[jewgold]]s}}
==The Law of Attraction==
[[Image:TheSecretLogo.jpg|thumb|No secret here.  Just bullshit.]]
The central idea here, ''The Law of Attraction'', states "[[Homosexual|like attracts like]]."  People's thoughts dictate reality (regardless of if they know it or not), and whatever you think of, you will experience. Essentially, "if you really want something and truly believe it's possible, you'll get it", but [[edit war|putting a lot of attention]] and thought onto something you [[DO NOT WANT|don't want]] means you'll probably get that too. Granted, the [[Fuckin Magnets|law of magnetism]] states that opposites attract, but fuck [[science]], we've got DVDs to shill.

===How The Secret Works===
[[Image:Thesecretcheck.png|thumb|Just add zeros.]]
There's no need for prayers, chanting, long-winded rituals or messy sacrifices - the path to enlightenment and cold, hard cash is thus.
#Ask
#Believe
#Receive 

That's right, folks.  In just three easy steps, you too can live your dreams in the wealth and comfort you so deserve.<br><br>
:Step 1 - Ask.  Just know what you want and [[stalker|focus on it with all your intent]].<br>
:Step 2 - Believe.  You must ''believe'' in the law of attraction, otherwise [[doing it wrong|it doesn't work]].  <br>
:Step 3 - Receive.  [[Profit|PROFIT!!!]]  Literally.  Just fill out that there check and put 'er under your pillow.  The wish fairy will be making her rounds shortly.

===Amazing Claims===
{{quote|I've seen kidneys regenerated. I've seen [[b|cancer]] dissolved.|Michael Beckwith|[http://www.agapelive.com/ Agape International Spiritual Center]}}

The film features [[cripple|one man]] who was paralyzed, mute, and on a ventilator after his spine and diaphragm were crushed in an airplane accident. He credits his full recovery to the power of his mind. A similar story is told by another interview whose breast cancer went into spontaneous remission without medical intervention. Those who died from lack of medical treatment were unavailable for comment.

===Evidence of Success===
Even though, as the DVD claims, "quantum physics is a part of the Law" - [http://blindinfluence.com/2009/10/magical-thinking-can-kill-you-2-dead-19-hospitalized-ater-paying-10000-for-seminar/ particle physics isn't listening].

==The Author==
'''Rhonda Byrne''' is the Australian television writer best known for her [[New age|New Thought]] works, The Secret â€” a book and DVD by the same name. She happily admits that the entire DVD was [[plagiarism|lifted]] from [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich The Science of Getting Rich], written [[srsly|100 years ago]].  Being the good reality t.v. producer she is, old Rhonda recycled a mishmash of [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|Dan Brown cutting-room scraps]], Rosicrucian images and muzak over a message of unadulterated greed. By the Spring of 2007 the book had sold almost 4 million copies, and the DVD had sold more than 2 million copies, proving yet again that [[fact|a fool and his money are soon parted.]] It's not often you find a plagiarized book turned into a DVD, which is then turned back into a book, but this is America - anything can happen.

==Misquotes from The Secret==
While it's fun to take quotes out of context and [[Fox News|twist the truth to fit one's agenda]], it's also a red flag that the author is either retarded or full of shit.  The Secret (mis)quotes the great [[Winston Churchill]] in a very underhanded way.

{{quote|You create your own universe as you go along.|Winston Churchill|according to The Secret}}

{{squote|Some of my cousins who had the great advantage of University education used to tease me with arguments to prove that nothing has any existence except what we think of it. The whole creation is but a dream; all phenomena are imaginary. '''You create your own universe as you go along'''. The stronger your imagination, the more variegated your universe. When you leave off dreaming, the universe ceases to exist. '''These amusing mental acrobatics are all right to play with. They are perfectly harmless and perfectly useless.''' I warn my younger readers only to ''treat them as [[the game|a game]]''. The metaphysicians will have the last word and defy you to  disprove their absurd propositions.|Winston Churchill|[http://henry.pha.jhu.edu/churchill.pdf actual quote]}}

They've even gone so far as to just completely make shit up.

{{quote|The secret is the answer to all that has been, all that is, and all that will ever be.|Ralph Waldo Emerson}}

[[Noone]] anywhere has been able to attribute this quote to Emerson except for the lunatics at The Secret.

==Facts and fun facts together==
THE SMART GOVERNMENT of Australia did not allowed Rhonda Byrne to publish her genius book inside Australia. Later that night Rhonda decides to move to [[USA|Heaven]] where she can sell her crap.

Some [[woman|woman]] that I don't remember her name sued rhonda byrne and claimed that she stole my work!

Most of the PHILOSOPHERS in the movie are dropouts or didn't even finished high school, the funny thing is they confess this on their seminars! (i.e [[fail|Bob Proctor]])

==SNL Parody==
Due to the concerted effort of people quietly wishing, the video is [[delete fucking everything|nowhere to be found]]... The March 17, 2007 episode of Saturday Night Live, cast members spoofed The Secret in a sketch with Oprah Winfrey (Maya Rudolph) interviewing Rhonda Byrne (Amy Poehler).  It includes a scene of a man in Darfur being interviewed by Winfrey and  Byrne. They scolded him when he lamented that his people were starving, saying it was all the result of his lousy attitude. 

In truly lulzy fashion, this played out less than a week later on "Nightline".  Bob Proctor, author of "You Were Born Rich" and one of the "gurus" Byrne quotes most often, was asked whether the starving children of Darfur had "manifested" -- that is, visualized -- their own misery. In utter seriousness, he replied, "I think the country probably has."
