'''Austin Fullmer''' is a 19 year old second-generation [[Scientologist]] who completely [[failed]] at his [[American Idol]] audition, and freaked out Simon Cowell. Austin's real job is processing [[feces|sewage]] so that it can be re-used in [[LA]] as [[Jenkem|drinking water]]. Appearing at one of the early auditions, when people are most likely to be complete [[retards]] and utterly lacking in talent, Austin attempted to sing a song by lame [[1970s]] [[rock]] band Cheap Trick.

==How do we know he's a Scilon?==

Apart from his horrible [[fashion]] sense, which is common in Scilons, former [[OSA]] agent Gary Scarff ("Smurf" on [[Enturbulation|Why We Protest]]) declared that he has known Austin's parents for years, and that they are [[hardcore]]. His [[batshit]] screaming at the judges has also been identified as an attempt at Scientology [[magic]] (Tone 40) to make people do what he says. Scientology works and it helps people.
