Stichting BREIN
[[Image:brein.png|thumb|right|The plan, as outlined by [[13-year-old_boy|/i/nsurgents]]?]]
'''Stichting BREIN''' is a [[Holland|Dutch]] company somewhat akin to the [[RIAA]] that apparently <del>thinks it can</del> just censored the [[Internet|need for porno]]. 

In July 2009, [[Conspiracy|they]] successfully managed to [[troll|persuade]] a judge to let ISPs (in the [[weed|Netherlands]]) block [[Pirate Bay|your el33t data source]]. The organizers of the Pirate Bay were given [[10]] days to block traffic to and from the [[Netherlands|Masters of Cheese]], or face stiff fines.

/[[b]]/, of course, after the recent [[AT&T blocks 4chan|AT&T spectacle]], was immediately up in its moralfaggotry. By using advanced [[DDoS|scripting techniques]] BREIN's website [[Power Rangers|morphed to]] sweet cyberspace oblivion.

[[zombie|BREIN]] has a history with this sort of [[faggotry|censorship]]. Popular BitTorrent tracker site [[shit nobody cares about|OiNK]] was [[Madagascar|shut down]] within five days of being reported to the company. The [[Unwarranted_self_importance|CEO]] of BREIN, Tim Kuik, is [[Last_thursday|currently]] under attack by [[Anonymous|friendly neighborhood hackers]].

BREIN has the [[bullshit|legal status]] of a citizen.

== The history ==
[[Image:Breinfail.jpg|thumb|The Pirate Bay bro-fists its homie Brein.]]
Stichting BREIN was founded [[over 9000]] years ago, during a meeting with a pissed-off record exec and some other guys. They were poor so they needed money for hookers and blow. BREIN was raised and the money kept rolling in. Whores all over Sweden rejoiced as there main source of income had not been cut off. BREIN is in fact the sockpuppet of some international record companies and some business model. [[fact|BREIN burns 20 million euro's each and every year]], just because they can.

The legal status of BREIN is known, but the legal status of the company that reels in the copyright money is not (they tend to be as large as they can... but its like an ant threatening to kill you). So if you're short on money; you might [[camwhore|lobby]] yourself here and also be burning cash at the end of the year.

Now that Tim is a multi-billionaire, he felt confident enough to tell everyone he did it for the lulz. Being TIM is a status now!

== Some HAET to BREIN ==
For all [[faggot|people]] who [[fail|think]] BREIN should be shut down, a special [[truth|non-privacy-sensitive]] page is [http://partyvan.info/wiki/Operation_Bre/i/n on /i/nsurgency w/i/ki].
