Danny Dunagin
[[image:Danny_dunigan_furious.jpg|thumb|right|STOP! [[Hammertime]]!!!]]
'''Danny Dunagin''' is a [[Scientologist]] and a rent-a-cop, combining perhaps two of the worst personality traits known to man in one [[idiot|thetan]].  He's also been doing his donut-munching gig at the front gates of Gold Base for at least 20 years, guarding [[David Miscarriage|Tiny David]]'s Fiefdom to his dying breath. He's an example school councillors give to trouble students on what's in store for them if they don't change their ways.

Danny is personally a very anti social person. He has been married at least twice, once to a poor woman named Gwen and another to the long-suffering Lia. Lia divorced him in 1999 or 2000. No wonder, he treated her like shit, as he did with Gwen.

He grew up on a German Air Force base where he learned to speak fluent German and how to suck a cock until your eyes stay crossed.

He has a brother named Chuck who works at a sooper seekrit Scientology bunker in New Mexico.

Danny is not OT3; he's not even Clear.  That means audio tape of LRH talking about Xenu should not be played around him, as that could affect his advancement up the bridge and we don't want that.

== What makes this faggot an asshole ==
Danny is a very unstable person that even fellow Scientologists at Gold Base think he is a complete dick.  He has physically struck staff members and, unlike [[David Miscarriage|The Dwarf]], he has been reprimanded for it.

It used to be if you were restricted to the Gold Base and could never leave, Danny was the person that would tell you where to go sleep or that you had to check in with because he was always the night guard at the Main booth.  After so many people were being restricted, there were no more places to sleep and you just had to find a spot under your desk or something, Danny treated you like crap and basically told you that you were a fuck-up and not having a place to sleep was your own damn problem even though security in most cases were the ones placing people on the restricted list.  In order to get off this list, Security had to attest and basically say that you were okay to go home each night. Danny Dunagin was the guy that would say yay or nay, so a lot of people he lives with hate him.

[[Some argue|Some people]] who have left Gold Base report not sleeping in their own beds for up to a year. One slept in a sleeping bag in an attic for months if not under his desk, and the only thing keeping him from sleeping in his own bed was Danny Dunagin and his personal vendetta against people that thought he was a [[fucktard]].  Danny probably has lost most of his ability or authority to inflict pain and suffering so assaulting protesters at Gold Base (on camera, no less) is his only outlet.

== He's a dog person ==
[[image:Danny dunigan attack at gold.jpg|left|300px]]Danny had an untrained dog in the 1990s that was killed by another dog at the Base. The dog that trolled Danny was named Iaxe and was a horse-sized German Shepard with some sort of DOOM infection that caused it to xbox hueg and creepypasta scary. It was John Gonzalvez's dog. John was in Cine Division and can be seen in some of the videos last year where they used to video protesters at Gold.

Not one to admit [[YHBT|HHBT]] and move on, Danny got a new attack dog which he took under his wing and the two were BBFs. Danny went to many training classes and was the dog's handler the entire time it was on Gold Base. This was $15,000 trained attack dog that they had in the main booth. The dog was obtained for the protection of [[David Miscarriage|David "Thumbellina" Miscavige]]. Clearwater and Celebrity Centre in Hollywood also had these same kind of dogs.

Danny was so arrogant and started telling people around the Int Base how his dog was trained to kill on command. This rumor spread around and when the in-house attorney's found out about this, the dog was disposed of as a legal liability they were not willing to deal with.  Yet another love lost.  To this day, Danny still has not found another friend.

== Danny and the Trailer ==
Danny lived in a trailer for a few years with his second dog (not wife), which is about as affluent as [[Sea Org]] members can get.  Funny thing is the trailer used to belong to Goldie Hawn and was a 5th wheel prarie schooner from 1983. He commandeered the trailer from Gold Base's Cine Division (where they make crappy internal cult propaganda films) so that he and the dog would have a place to live close to the main booth.  When the trailer was taken back back Cine, it took weeks to get the smell of Danny and/or the dog out of the trailer so that it could be used for location shooting.

== Shattering Suppression ==
In the 1990's Danny Dunagin was in the main booth at Gold one day and some Suppressive Person drove up to the guard booth and started talking smack to him. Danny came out of the guard booth and slugged the guy while he was sitting in his car. This was a big no no and Scientology got sued. The SP guy won and got a cash payout. Danny was then put on night guard shift for about 10 years.
