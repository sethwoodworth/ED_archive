Individual poor [[allegedly]] have very little [[money]], not even enough to afford an [[AOL]] account. Thus there are no poor on the [[internets]], because although they have the same amount of disposable income as the [[internet poor]], they wisely prefer to spend it on the mildly [[addictive]] necessities of life - such as [[alcohol]] and [[crack]] - rather than cripplingly addictive pastimes such as [[MMORPG]]s. Many of the poor act like a twisted evil twin of a [[camwhore]], except instead of hiding their [[ugly]] on the internets with [[internet disease]] so sad bastards will send them money to see their [[boobs]], the poor try to look as ugly as possible [[IRL]] so people will give them money to go away now [[plzkthx]]. Poor people are sometimes referred to as "povs", short for [[impoverished]].

Poor are not to be confused with [[hobo]]s, which are honest, working people who travel across the nation attempting to liberate us from the U.S. government. For more information on hobos, consult ''[[The Areas of My Expertise]]'', an almanac containing information on many things, including hobos and their names.
             
Poor is also what the [[USA]] (and subsequently the rest of the [[Commonwealth|world]]) is going to be when [[Global economic downturn|the recession]] turns into a depression. And that includes all kinds of poverty: [[Africa|material poverty]], Jew, and [[Muslim|putting faith above everything else]].
