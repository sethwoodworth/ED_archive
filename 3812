{{lj|user=Hyakynthos}} is a new-age [[pagan]] e-group and [[LiveJournal]] regular who is known for his [[bipolar disorder]], pasty white ass and overall lack of style. Like most of the [[insane]] [[bitches]] on his short [[LiveJournal]] friends list, he plays "musical religions" at least once a month.

He claims to be a "Hellenic pagan", which is similar to a regular [[pagan]], except with more old people. Hellenic pagans still worship Zeus and Aphrodite, and they dress up in bedsheets which do nothing to hide their [[fat]]ness. Hyakynthos was naturally attracted to Hellenic paganism because it afforded him the chance to indulge in [[pedophilia]], his favorite hobby, just as it was among the ancient [[Greek]]s. 

== Early history and rape victims ==

Hyakynthos was a Jehovah's Witness but, by his own account, quickly discovered his natural [[stupid]]ity and became [[Wiccan]]. He also became involved in [[Discordianism]], but was cast out of those circles by the other [[in the ass|boy-fucking]] Discordians, who probably felt threatened by Hyakynthos's propensity for frequent flashbacks to occasions when he was nearly caught with little boys in park restrooms and convenience store bathrooms.

== Profession ==
Hyakynthos is presently a [[NaNoWriMo]] writer, which means he writes bullshit online and makes no money doing it. He claims to have been a married man once, but this is so absurd as to be ignored. Since NaNoWriMo is another way of saying "I can't get a job," the truth is that Hyakynthos is unemployed.

Many suspect that the cause of his unemployment is due to the fact that no work-place will allow someone to write posts on LiveJournal, ass around on [[Yahoo!]] groups for 24 hours a day and develop man-tits while receiving a pay-check.

== Hyakynthos and his driver's license ==
For years, Hyakynthos had to drive without a driver's license because his was suspended by a judge during his eleventh pre-trial hearing regarding the 8 year old boy he [[rape]]d in the playground of a grade school in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. After sneaking around for many years without insurance or a license or tags, the Greek [[god]] Hermes "joined" Hyakynthos's pantheon and got him his driver's license. Now, Hyakynthos can again cruise around neighborhood swing-sets and parks looking for young children to [[rape]].

== Current activities==
Hyakynthos spends his time online, being a lame dumbass in LiveJournal and on [[Yahoo!]]. There is nothing more for him to do than make senseless posts addled with [[bipolar]] ramblings and ravings, spreading lies and gossip around the [[internet]], and going into chat rooms looking for more children to [[rape]].
