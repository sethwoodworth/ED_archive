'''2-J''' is the admin of a popular Gorillaz fansite, [http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com Gorillaz-unofficial].  There he rains fire down on his serfs and makes macabre demands in a dancing, cackling voice which is always at the edge of your teeth.
He is also a [[sick fuck]] [[pedo]] [http://www.12chan.org 12chan] regular, and a [[weeaboo]].


==The first offence(7/22/06)==
[[Image:thestoryofthesituation2-J.gif|thumb|The Story]]
The events that happened on this day will never be forgotten.  Tusm and JOHN, users at [http://www.gorillaz-unofficial.com Gorillaz-unofficial],  were life-banned and the users Stripe and Strongbad were put on "probation" for [[h4x0r|"attacking"]] the [http://chat.gorillaz-unofficial.com gorillaz-unofficial chat].  These attacks were merely the said users cloning other people and creating new rooms. Why would anybody get all huffy about having cracked admin privileges like that? After said "attacks" the chat was taken down.  Soon after, the user Craze_Dragon was banned for a month for hosting an alternative chat, called [http://www.clanddr.com/chat/zx Gorillaz-Unofficial-Democracy](Now known as the ZX Chat) for use of the gorillaz-unofficial chatters while the chat located at Gorillaz-Unofficial was down.

==The YTMND's==
Two YTMND's were created by user Craze_Dragon: [http://fortpedo.ytmnd.com FortPedo] and [http://twojgayday.ytmnd.com 2-J Is Gay Day]. This name is misleading, as every day is 2-J Is Gay Day.

Dear Craze_Dragon,
unfortunately, due to your actions during the one
month period, you have
been banned from
Gorillaz-Unofficial.com for life.

Firstly, you left a comment on one of bassman's
ytmnds urging him to vote
for
the ytmnd 'fortpedo.ytmnd.com', which is designed to
insult me.

Secondly, for your comments in the G-U Democracy
chat about me. This
includes, but was not
limited to, the following extract:-

"22:32:48 [Tusm] James is half retarded.
22:33:03 [Craze] Only half? I disagree."

I lay out the money for this site and spend my time
on it, and you expect me
to let you back in
after such behaviour? The question was rhetorical,
there is no right of
appeal.

Dear 2-J,

I will not deny doing any of the said actions in the
last email but I fail to see what any of that has to
do with me being banned at a site that has nothing to
do with any of it. Once again thank you for your
time.

The site doesn't have anything to do with the actions, no.

I'm just banning you because I can. As the owner of a private website
I'm
free to allow / deny
access to who I see fit, regardless of any notion of 'fairness' or
'justice'. Interesting concept, no?

You've gone out of your way to try and insult me in a vile manner, now
I've
denied you access to
a website under my control (fine, you can still visit under another IP,
but
you'll never get into, e.g.
the VIP section, or be able to post as 'Craze Dragon' on either the
forum or
the main page, without
those posts being deleted). Why should I allow someone access to my
site,
who has gone out of
their way to insult me? If you were providing a service, at your own
expense
and at the cost of
your own time, would you not seek to stop someone taking advantage of
that
service, if that
person had tried to insult you? Well, regardless of whether you
personally
would or not, I would,
and I think that many people would agree with my decision.

==The E-Mail that was sent to 2-J from Stripe(7/26/06)==
Dear Bestest Friend, 2-J:

'''YOU LITTLE FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! YOU BASTARD, WHY DID YOU BAN CRAZE? HE DID NOTHING WRONG!''' Wait, wait. You [[ban]]ned him just because he didn't fit in to your [[website]], or is it that you [[I did it for the lulz|banned him because you could?]] Because I see something wrong with banning someone because you [[fuck]]ing [[masturbate|felt]] like it. Do you know how [[batshit insane|fucked up]] that is? Tusm was right, YOU ARE half [[retard]]ed. Does it make you feel more like a [[man]] that you can make fun of [[13 year old boy|fourteen year old]]s because they're a mod in a chat that you disapprove of? You fucking [[pedophile]]. You fucking [[homo]]. I can't [[sic|beleve]] that you had the balls to tell your lame [[ass]] "[[community]]" that we "[[hack]]ed" your [[chat]]. You made it sound like we're [[Jihadophile|terrorist]]s, but we're not. What goes around, comes around, 2-J. When the day that your [[shit]]ty site falls apart finally comes, you better remember that we told you so.

By the way, banning someone because they insulted you is very immature. YOUR FUCKING 23, 2-J. GROW UP AND [[14/f/cali|ACT]] LIKE IT. Another thing, why the fuck did you call your "The New Chat-O" when it didn't even in the slightest way possible, resemble the original Chat-O? Also, let me remind you that your site was created to get a way from the n00bs, not to fucking welcome them in. Let me quote you on something, "the Gorillaz-Unofficial chat suffered a number of attacks" THERE WAS NO FUCKING ATTACKS ASSHAT. We were messing around, damn. Although, an asshole like you probably wouldn't know the meaning of "[[fun]]".

In conclusion, '''YOU CAN SHOVE YOUR SHITTY WEBSITE, YOUR SHITTY CHAT, YOUR SHITTY MESSAGE BOARDS, YOUR SHITTY KULA SHAKER, AND ALL YOUR SHITTY FANS UP, YOUR SHITTY PEDO-HOMO ASS.'''

Your friend,
Stripe

==The E-Mail that was sent to 2-J from CSniper(7/28/06)==
Hey, you're a cool guy and everything. Thanks for 3 years, you rocked. I am now going to break all contact with you to fuck your head up (:

It seems to me that:
Either you are responsible for the posts of your users
-or-
The users own the content of their own posts.

Therefore, I want all of my posts and threads deleted. This is to break any connection that I have with your website and esteemed self. I know that friends are disposable objects to you (see: Rosalinda, Strongbad), so this should be no real problem at all. Furthermore, I would like to be free from your totalitarian policy on visiting other chatrooms and "collaberating" with ex-chat members. While you do, indeed, own the gorillaz-unofficial website and the laws of freedom of speech do not apply, I do have the right to tell you to kiss my ass over hotmail.

Also, do not try to keep all this quiet. I want to see what happens when people hear that you ban veteran members of the board for seemingly random things. I'm sure it will be great fun. Post my banning in the appropriate topic in Announcements, or I will do it for you on the OMB.

Have a nice day,

<nowiki>****** ****</nowiki>

"CSniper" AKA Anessen

==Renegade Mods!1111!!!!11(7/31/06)==
Chia, after posting a rant, then went on to locking every topic CSniper made to try and talk to 2-J.  The latest is an unknown admin/mod (COUGHhomusabiCOUGH) is now deleting all topics (AHGHURMmadwithpowerGHEH) related to the situation on sight (AKGHWEHEHEslowlykillingusHGGUHMH).

==Dahaka==
Dahaka is 2-J's bitch. Although 6 months ago he was all like "OMFG FUKK U U GU FAGGS" now he is loyal to 2-J.
Yet, he still trolled 2-J's chat. It is amazing, this Dahaka is such a [[retarded]] [[sick fuck]].
At the moment, he gets his kicks by destroying this entry, and trying to h4xx0rz the ZX chat, which he can't seem to do. Please don't do that, Dahaka.  It also seems that he has gotten this page blocked from edits because of his cuntery. The bastard. Dahaka has proven that he is mentally ill by watching this page to see if it ever will be unprotected.

==2mur&Dirty Bird==
Two half retarded members of the official message board that started the "fu<k the GU" thread.  Both of them were subject to chat kicks upon nearly every entrance into the chat, as well as suffering from flames and sick jokes from some of the most communist members of the GU, such as Turkatron and MSKo09.

==Things 2-J can ban you from==
*Gorillaz-Unofficial
*OMB
*[[IRL]]
*several VHF/UHF frequencies

==Users Banned At The Moment==
*Tusm 
*CSniper 
*Craze_Dragon 
*JOHN
*Stripe
*Strongbad
*PeNuT
*[[Waaaambulance|Other people who hate 2-J and his stupid crummy website and didn't want to be on it anyway so there]]



==Current Situation==
Everyone is still bnanned from the G-U at the present, and 2-J has STILL not removed CSniper's information. In fact, his server crashed and Strongbad was lucky enough to get in when his info was up. Shortly after doing so, Strongbad was re-bnanned for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. AGAIN. What the [[fuck]] is this [[shit]]?  Our only consolation is that our friends on the forum are [[dead]] because it happened [[at least 100 years|so fucking long]] ago.
