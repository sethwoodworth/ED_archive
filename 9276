YouTube Independence Day
[[Image:Youtubescripts1.jpg|thumb|right]]

Independence Day, 2010. A date which will go down in infamy. 
At approximately 4am Central time, an exploit in youtube's commenting feature was discovered. Shortly thereafter 4chan's /v/(but we all know it was [[Ebaums]]) got a hold of it and a shitstorm ensued. The exploit let any user simply copy and paste html in to a video's comment field to ruin a viewer's day. At first, it was used to simply fuck with the layout and add marqeeed and bolded text. It eventually was used to redirect certain videos to goatse and other [[shock site]]s. In [[Youtube]]'s slow response, some users took it upon themselves to being uploading porn. Four hours after the first sighting, youtube is in safety mode, and comments are not displayed by default. New scripts can't be posted, due to wordfilters, but existing scripts still work. Stay tuned to ED for updates and never forget Ebaums did 7-4-10.

==Update==
[[File:Youtube_safety_mode.jpg|center|frame|Safety mode is just the first step in their plot to end free speech]]
As of July the 4th around 2:30pm the characters "<" and ">" are no longer allowed in youtube comments due to filthy jewtube kikes. This means that you can't use the scripts anymore. ;_;
As of 2:40pm GMT all scripts have been disabled. It is over.

== Variety Is The Spice Of Life ==

During the initial onset of the YouTube Independence Day (YID) attack the majority of scripts being used were basic to say the least.  Generally involving nothing more than a marquee and some text saying things such as "You've been hacked" or "LOL fags".  While this was enough to satisfy the amateur script kiddies out there soon others began working to see just what types of things could be done with the commenting system.  Soon variations were popping up all over the place, literally.  Pop up messages began to inform users that, among other things, Justin Beiber had died in a horrific car crash or that their system 32 folder had become infected and should be purged immediately.  

Soon even more types of scripts were being used like ones that would black out the majority of the page and scroll messages by for the user.  With each and every new iteration the denizens of Ebaums World rejoiced as they were able to stick it to the man harder and harder with each passing minute.  Not satisfied with simply screwing with Youtube users by implementing these different scripts all of which had the added bonus of disabling the ability to comment, rate, favorite, or flag a video, even more variations appeared.

Soon redirects were in full force as people who only wanted to watch the newest Fred video were instead sent to Lemonparty or other various shock sites.  "Hey it's Fred!" was soon replaced with "OMG is that guy shoving a bottle up his ass.... Oh fuck did it just break?"  And again the users of Ebaums World were pleased with themselves.  Even more fun was had when it was realized by the slow witted fucks that because the scripts disabled the ability to flag a video a user could potentially upload any type of porn they pleased, comment on their own video with a script, and sit back and laugh as YouTubers was forced to watch things ranging from CP to Scat fights.

Alas all good things must come to an end eventually and soon the one Google employee who didn't have a massive hangover from the company party the night before shit brix and then disabled comments by utilizing the "Safety" mode on YouTube.  While this didn't completely stop the fun it did make it so people would have to click the "Show Comments" button to enable the scripts to work.  Within a few hours Google removed the ability to use scripts within the comment sections of video and ended what as perhaps the best 4th of July Google's ever thrown.

==White Knights==
Eventually some YT users started posting videos about the "hacking."
