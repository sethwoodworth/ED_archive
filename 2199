{{notice|'''REMEMBER:''' Depression is a [[Bullshit|serious medical condition!]]}}
'''Depression''' is a higher state of consciousness in which your [[Bullshit|pleasant illusions]] are dispelled, leading [[You|you]] to realise your utter irrelevance and worthlessness. Comprehension of this higher truth inevitably leads [[You|you]] to the [[Suicide|only acceptable solution]].

This state is incorrectly perceived by mainstream society as a medical condition, arguably because a depressed person tends to destabilise the pleasant illusions of others.

Depression is a nonexistent condition made up by neglected children of work mommies and daddies. Not surprisingly, however, [[16 year old girls]] and [[emo]] kids also adopt depression as a fashion accessory for [[attention whoring]] purposes. 
			
Depressed people display specific symptoms that include contemplating [[suicide]], listening to [[shitty bands|shit music]], and writing 10 entries a day on [[LiveJournal]]. If a friend or loved one tells you that they are depressed or suicidal, you can see if this is the case by [[trolling]] them mercilessly, both [[OL]] and [[IRL]]. If you drive them to [[suicide]], then they were probably genuinely depressed, and the world is better off without them bringing down everyone's buzz. But if they donâ€™t top themselves, you should kill them right where they stand, because they are lying posers and not worth listening to. 

Depressed people are often [[cutters]], and have a good self-indulgent crying-and-glue-huffing session multiple times a day. Plus they smell like [[shit]] and [[My Chemical Romance|Gerard Way's]] semen, which is probably why they cut themselves.

== Other Common Symptoms ==

* Being a [[loser]]
* Not being a [[winner]] 
* [[Liberalism|Feeling personal guilt for the state of the world]] 
* [[aspie|Increased sensitivity to criticism]]
* [[Laziness|Fatigue]]
* [[Psychosomatic]] [[illness]]

== The Depression of the 1930's ==

'''HOLY SHIT!  THE DOW IS DOWN 500 POINTS AND BANKS ARE GONNA START CLOSING. YOU CAN THANK THE SPICS AND WHITEYS WHO TOOK LOANS WITH 200% INTEREST AFTER 3 YEARS TO FINANCE THEIR OVERPRICED HOMES. LOAD UP YOUR GUNS CAUSE WE GUNNA HAVE A REVOLUTION!!!'''

The Depression was a period of poverty and unemployment in American and European history. It began in 1929 and lasted until roughly 1939.

The period began with the collapse of prices on the New York Stock Exchange in October of 1929. Many experts believe that the prices were unable to hold up under their many layers of white makeup, eyeliner, and metal chains and spikes weighing several pounds per item of clothing. The prices continued to fall over the next three years, as their knees became more and more stressed by their [[fat|obesity]]. Many banks were forced into insolvency, and by 1933 11,000 of the United States' banks had failed, usually after the employees committed mass [[suicide]]s while playing Nirvana albums. One executive who survived a suicide attempt was quoted as saying, "Kurt was so right, man. It's better to burn out than to fade away."

The public quickly lost confidence in the economy, and the country continued its downward spiral. As consumers spent less and less money on anything besides hard liquor, output dropped drastically and unemployment rates skyrocketed. Many Americans moved back into their parents' homes, taking menial jobs in exchange for a couch in the basement. By 1932, 12 to 15 million workers were unemployed.

Cleverly dubbed "Hoovervilles", assemblages of cardboard boxes inhibited by [[assholes]], popped up across the land. People fought over pieces of glass and hair to eat. Most newborns were eaten too. However, a reluctant President Hoover didn't consider it advantageous to take any sort of action. He concluded that the economy itself would sort out its problems eventually.

===Hoover's Brain===

Hoover did perform one particular symbolic act, though. In February 1930, he presented to Peter Geisha (an obscure turnip farmer) the Frozen Toad, an award established to reward individuals who worked too hard for their own good without actually kicking the bucket. The award trophy itself was a ceramic statue depicting a frozen, tired-looking toad. This occasion was the first and last on which this award was ever presented, and remained the single greatest landmark of Hoover's presidency.

The following year another, though not as successful, symbolic deed was carried through by the president. His initiative to issue a special edition of the $10 bill was passed, with the intention of cheering up the common man. The new bill was completely analogous to the ordinary one, apart from a drawing of a laughing puppy in its lower right corner. Furthermore, it was not accepted as currency anywhere. Some 100,000 special edition bills were dropped over major cities, as a joke.

===FDR: "I'm gay"===

[[Image:Allisonfdr.jpg|thumb|While FDR's "fireside chats" helped restore public trust in government, it also made people feel comfortable shitting on his legacy at the FDR memorial.]]

As the Depression worsened, [[Democrat]] Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected [[President]]. Months of preceding campaigning had turned into an ugly bloodbath in most parts of the country, with desperate people resorting to demonstrative self-mutilation, cannibalism, unfair name-calling and annoying big band music.

The turbulence culminated on election day, when hordes of ungrateful citizens wreaked unrest immediately after Roosevelt's victory. A team of college-employed militants plotted to smother the new president with pies. They were however shot in the brain before getting anywhere near him. Workers committed large-scale illegal strikes to promote their own dubious motives. These were swiftly transferred to invisible labor camps, together with their families.

Instantly after Roosevelt was installed, he left little doubt about his main priorities. A law passed to legalize beer, left people assured that better times were ahead. The following law making the import of opiates compulsory to all merchants, led to further glee and optimism.

The Bluetooth Project, a top classified scheme to install chutes on every street of central Washington D.C. so that wine could flow in them, was discontinued after research proved it difficult - even the least sophisticated wine would still make it too costly. Instead, the chutes were (for a short period during 1933) flowed with mayonnaise.

Despite the government's best efforts, the slump continued until 1939.

===War etc.===

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe, employment began to grow thanks to the overseas demand for armaments and munitions. In 1941, the United States entered the war, and in these more simple times, this was enough to motivate Americans to dress like normal people and go out and get a fucking job, already.

Today, the generation that lived through this period is known as "the greatest generation" because of their ability to recover from the Depression with only the threat of a massive global extinction due to nuclear warfare that would leave the earth a scorched, barren rock populated only by the mutant offspring of the few unfortunate survivors of the devastation.

=== [[Hobo]]s ===

Every boxcar should have one.

A race of drunken, Depression era, ne'er-do-well, old dirty [[/b/tard]]s, they roamed the land with their suits and afros in 'kerchief bundles on sticks.

Later organized by FDR into what would become the nation's first Compartment (after the trains they jacked and rode) of Habboland Security, they covertly went willy-nilly/hither and yon/far and wide searching for the nascent [[Habbo]] menace and their [[Nazi|Mod]] [[The Man|cult leaders]] after they crashed the stock market during a reset when a bunch of Brillo-haired nigras came in thinking Black Tuesday (October 29, 1929) was like Ladies' Night for blacks.

The Hobos were a "mens' only" club, however they should not to be confused with ghey [[Gay|Homos, Habbos and/or Habbo-Homos]]. This confusion is aided by the fact that they were all devoted {{youtube|KOG_PwDotEc|p&aelig;dophiles}} (continued {{youtube|6ZBo2BARTvU|here}}).

Little is known of the Great Hobo Vanishing, but it is thought that they now live in [[Lord of the Rings|Middle Earth]] as Deros (DetrimentalRobots) and await the next Habbo threat.
