The '''faggot icon''' craze swept through [[LiveJournal]]'s [[homosexual|gay]] community in [[2004]], following [[intervocalic]]'s rant about the word "faggot" being the worst possible thing one could call a homosexual. In response to this, a [[troll]] operating under the [[e-dentity]] [[mediacart]] created an [[icon]] which cyclically flashed the word "FAGGOT!" across a photograph of {{lj|user=intervocalic}}.

The subsequent demand for such icons by other gay [[LJ user]]s was such that [[JeremyJX]] and [[rfjason]] founded the {{ljcomm|user=faggot_icons}} [[communities|community]]. Soon, the "faggot icon" became the must-own fashion accessory of the Fall / Winter.

===Also===
[[Samwell]] is a true icon for [[faggot|faggots]] world-wide!
