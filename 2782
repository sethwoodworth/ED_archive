'''Travis Mason-Bushman''' is better known to his diaper loving friends as "Attendsboi" ("Attends" is a brand of diapers). His particular fetish is called [[Infantilism|infantilism]].  He loves the thought of being an "adult baby." He is also a [[Self-diagnosed|self-diagnosed]] [[aspie]], as one can tell by looking at his Wikipedo user page, where he lists the types of airplanes he's ever flown on, and the name of every California State Park he has ever visited, etc. 

For the benefit of readers in [[moar]] civilized countries, '''DIAPER''' is the [[Americunt]] word for '''NAPPY'''. [[Don Imus]] and his [[Jamaica]]n-born teachers are among the enlightened few.

==A Classic Wikipedian==

You can't find a greater example of Wikipedian-hood. A mind-salad of paranoia, power-infusion, and constant on-the-alertness, if you examine Travis you might spend some time wondering who pooped in his diaper, until you really get the point ([[OMG]] no!).

What's most confusing, of course, is why FCYTravis has worked so hard on so many other sites before Wikipedia, and then deleted all his good works. For example, [[FCYTravis/livejournal|here is a perfectly well-maintained livejournal he used to keep about his diaper fetish]]. He deleted all his postings on the TeenBaby forums, too, but we have them in the gallery, below. Man, talk about crawling away quickly!

==Exploits in Adult Baby-land ([[FCYTravis/livejournal|see Screencaps]] and Gallery below)==

* Displaying a "This user is a professional writer or journalist" tag on his bio page when in fact he edits his community college newspaper. [[Essjay]] would be proud.

'''Prefers Plastic Pants over his Diapers'''

*"I like them, especially with poopy diapers... they do a good job of keeping the smell in. :)"

'''On the Eternal Question of "What are you wearing right now?"'''

*"A rather wet (and stinky Embarrassed) Molicare Super Plus with two pairs of plastic pants to keep in the smell *WINK*."

'''[[Cum|Came]] to Party!'''

*"It's Friday night and [[Basement Dweller|my parents are gone]] until Sunday evening... That means Diapees! :D Got a wet SecurePlus, a new Playtex baba and a nice, comfy blankee. Life is good. :)"

'''[[lie|Comes from a Loving Family]]'''

*"I'm sitting five feet away from my father, who, well, obviously enough knows... kinda hard to hide the waddle factor even with jammie bottoms over it. ;)"

'''Admits his Flaws'''

*"[[sick fuck|What am I besides a kid who isn't toilet-trained?]]" (note: age 21 when he wrote this.)

'''Suffers in Silence'''

*"I'm sitting in a crappy Walgreens store brand doubled with a small Medline brief."

==Exploits on Wikipedia==

'''Doesn't Let Power Go to His Head'''

*"Vandalizing the user page of an admin is not a smart thing to do. If I were in a worse mood, I'd block you. But instead I just dizzleted yer vanity. Again." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CommanderCool&oldid=21756959 August 24, 2005])

'''Shows an Amazing Clarity of Logic'''

*"They have not been made by any criminal court, nor any public prosecutor, nor has he been arrested for any crime. I can file a lawsuit callling you a murderer. That doesn't mean I can put on your Wikipedia bio "Travis Mason-Bushman accused Michael Zeleny of murder." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Larvatus&oldid=41493765 December 23, 2005])

'''Thinks of the Children'''

*"Giving such instruction is part of the role of Wikipedia - how would you encyclopedically describe a condom without talking about its employment? Wikipedia is not censored for the protection of minors - even if not showing how to install a condom would somehow "protect minors" from... what, exactly? "The interest of modesty" is not a factor, beyond not linking the image inline. If someone is looking for information about condoms, they're going to get it. It's not like the evil Condom Monster is going to leap out at kids looking at Cookie Monster - OMG HERES A CONDOM OOOOOH LOOK HERE!!" - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Condom/Archive_1&oldid=34170653 November 26, 2005])

'''Knows His Priorities'''

*"I reverted the unexplained replacement of the male model with a female model. I see no particular reason why the bikini pic is any more informative, and I suspect some sort of bias in believing that somehow a woman in a bikini is more of a swimsuit model than a man in a low-cut suit." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Swimsuit&oldid=40746645 November 25, 2005])

'''Politely Presents Mature Examples in Arguments'''

*"There is no personal attack in my reply. Please point out to me the alleged attack. As for fuck, Using the word "fuck" in every other word of an article would clearly not be very encyclopedic, would it? Please explain to me in which article using "fuck" every other word would contribute to the encyclopedic clarity and informative properties of the article. On the other hand, a photo of someone performing [[autofellatio]] is perfectly encyclopedic in the context of an encyclopedia article on that act." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit/Archive_1&oldid=21638655 August 17, 2005])

'''Steps Carefully around Cutting-Edge Web Technologies'''

*"I have not seen any other animated GIFs on Wikipedia... is it really necessary?" - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:O_RLY%3F&oldid=42496761 December 19, 2005])

'''Was There When [[Lies|Wikipedia was cool]]'''

*"Wikipedia is being taken over by [[13 year old boys|puerile kindergarten dropouts]]." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBrian_Peppers_%286th_nomination%29&diff=40044636&oldid=40041195 February 17, 2006])

'''A Brave Defender Against Goals Supporting "the Community"'''

*"The prime directive of Wikipedia is to write [[shit nobody cares about|a free encyclopedia]]. The 'community' exists in order to support that goal, not the other way around." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:User_prerogatives/Archive&oldid=34395216 January 1, 2006])

'''A Man Who Knows What He Wants'''

*"If someone goes looking for '[[Penis]]' on Wikipedia, they should find a photo." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Penis&oldid=43734399 December 21, 2005])

'''Like, Really Knows What He Wants'''

*"A penis is simply... a penis. It's an anatomical thing, not something to hide with 'tact.' We have a picture of a condom atop the Condom page, a picture of an airliner atop Airliner and we should have a picture of a penis at Penis." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Penis&oldid=43734399 January 17, 2006])

'''And Always a Gentle and Caring Spirit to Other Faiths'''

*"If you don't think autofellatio is discussed in sexuality courses, you must have taken them at [[Christian|Bob Jones University]]." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_encyclopedic_merit/Archive_1&oldid=21638655 August 17, 2005])

===Summing up===
'''And the Reviews are in'''

*"Um... well, the photo is me. The rest is, well, agenda." - ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:FCYTravis&oldid=44743857 March 20, 2006], uh oh, [[Oversight|overseen]]!)

===On a Wikipedian Site===
'''And FCYTravis is in the Review!'''

Like many other Wikipedian [[Bureaucratic Fucks|admin]]s, [http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?act=Search&nav=au&CODE=show&searchid=d371c1b1d11f21e9b0b1449032d5a60e&search_in=posts&result_type=posts FYC Travis is avid to help out] with the accelerating [[fail|demise]] of the [[Wikipedia Review|Wikipedian's Review]].

===[[Sick Fuck]]===
'''And a Review of FCYTravis'''

Contemplating the extreme [[sick fuck]]ery of FCYTravis, one has to admit he is less of a [[cunt]] than most of his fellow [[Wikipedo]]es. So what do '''they''' do for [[fun]]?

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:FCYTravis FCY Travis at Wikipedia] There is tons of lulzy shit about him there, not yet covered in this article.
