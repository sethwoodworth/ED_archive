==Timeline O' The Future==

*2033 - [[Russia|Russia]] gets bombed and the citizens are forced to live in the underground metro stations surrounding the area, as mutations occur, a new species is created called the Dark ones. Nobody knows what they do, but it appears they have telepathic abilities.
 2041 - Famous home shopping center Lowe's is aquired in a hostile takeover by Home Depot Gmbh (Now run by [[Germany|Germans]]). People realize the future isn't all that different from [[2005]].
*2077 - Prepared for a nuclear or biological attack from China, the President and the Enclave retreats to remote sections around the globe and make contingency plans for continuing the war.  A few months later, Nuka Cola Quantum is released to the public just hours before the bombs are launched. Who struck first is unknown, and it is not even known if the bombs came from China or America. Other countries, seeing the missiles on their way, launch their planes and fire their warheads as well. Air raid sirens sound, but very few people go into vaults, thinking it is a false alarm. The Vaults are sealed. What ensues is two hours of nuclear bombardment upon the earth's surface. The effects are far worse than most imagined. The earth's faults shift violently. Mountain ranges thrust themselves through the soil. Whole lands are submerged under floods of water. The Necropolis Vault never closes. Once it becomes known that the other vaults have sealed, people within Bakersfield, CA attempt to force their way into Vault 12 to protect themselves and their families.

*9001 - Some argue the [[Internets]] will stop due to a catastrophic event, somewhat akin to the dreadfull [[Y2K]] tragedy, ending the [[Shit|world as we know it]]. Also expect some [[Worldwide Masonic Conspiracy|fucked up shit]], and possibly a better [[Over 9000|meme depicting very large numbers]].
