Geoshities

Yahoo! '''GeoShities''' was a [[free]] webhosting service founded by David Bohnett and John Rezner [[at least 100 years ago|at least 100 internets ago]] as Beverly Hills Internet.  It had nothing to do with Beverly Hills, and everything to do with [[16 year old girls]], soccer moms, [[Vinny the Rapist|Your Uncle Steve]] and everyone who wanted a free webpage with no bandwidth or storage. [[Image:Halo.1.4.jpg|thumb|right|HAY GUYS CHECK THIS OUT]]

It turned into an overly [[fat|bloated]] [[crap]]fest within a few years.  Anybody, and I mean anybody could have their ''very own webpage yippiee yay [[lol]]'' which made the place slow as [[fuck]], since everybody was crammed onto like 3 servers in somebody's [[basement]]. [[Some argue]] that it's amazing that Geoshitties still exists as it clearly is not [[Web 2.0]] and as such is [[lemonparty|old]].

Despite all this, the company managed to go public and get stocks and everything, which made [[Yahoo!]] crap its pants cause that was their job.  So they bought out Geocities, and made it even worse somehow.  The price?  $3.57 '''billion'''.  Yes, [[Penn and Teller|that's Carl Sagan '''billion''' with a B]].

==Popular Uses==
Today, the service is the perfect place to put your [[fanfic]] and [[slash]] and stupid [[shit nobody cares about]]...  Until it gets popular because the [[internets]] are fickle, and then it craps out every hour on the hour until [[Yahoo!]] gets off their ass and gives you more bandwidth.  Of course, you could always [[what|buy bandwidth for your free service]], which just makes you [[fuck]]ing [[stupid]].
==Neighborhoods==
The sites were devided into "neighborhoods" with [[shit|fun]] names to ease in finding content and people with similar interests.

==[[Jim Morrison|The End]]==
Yahoo [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/24/geocities_bye/ announced on April 23, 2009] that they will finally be dealing with their three and a half billion dollar [[fail|mistake]].  On October 26, 2009 management [[delete fucking everything|removed]] every site on Geoshities.  The service has been taken off-line for good. The only people taking exception to this are niggers. Why? We don't rightly know.

And [[nothing of value was lost]]. [[Goodnight_Sweet_Prince|GOODNIGHT, SWEET PRINCE]]. <h4>HOO-FUCKING RAY</h4>

The Geocities spirit of [[shit|shitty]] pages covered in animated GIFs, embedded music and eye-searing color schemes lives on at thousands of profile pages on [[MySpace]].

Also, it still lives on [[Japan]], who's suprised?
