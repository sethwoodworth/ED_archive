The '''Macbook Air ''' is the most [[hipster|minimalistic]] laptop released by [[hipster]] super giant, [[Apple]]. It has a thickness of only 0.76 inches at its thickest part, much like that of an [[asian]] [[penis]], with a brushed aluminum case to draw the [[hipsters]] in.  The laptop itself has proved itself to be near impractical, as it lacks many of the features that actual laptops have.  However, because it has brushed metal, and was released by [[apple]], [[hipsters]] and yuppies alike wet their panties and coughed up the cash.

But the Macbook Air's best feature by far is its lack of a pesky and unimportant firewire port or a disc drive. The Macbook Air only costs a trivial [[over 9000|$1,800]], which is $700 more than a normal Macbook. This cost increase is a very understandable fee to rid yourself of [[faggotry]] such as multiple USB devices, anything requiring a file upload rate of [[at least 100|over 11MB/s]], ethernet, expandable RAM, built-in wireless broadband, a replaceable battery, DVDs, and especially CDs, which are all [[lie|obsolete]].<br>


Yes, these are much less important than being able to fit it in your pants, and anybody who claims that Apple just took out parts to make it thinner, and thus a gimmick, are unpatriotic [[moot|faggots]] who will burn in the eternal hellfire that is functionality.<br>

Of course all macfags all over the [[internets]] are buying this [[shit]] in a heart beat. 
If they are that anal about [[masturbate|moving parts]] they can get a '''SOLID STATE HD WITH LESS SPACE''' for an extra '''[http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&node=home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air $1000]!'''
(srsly.)

{{quote|who would pay $800 more for a MBA when the regular macbook is faster, has many more features (by my count the MBA has 1 on the macbook, which is the multitouch trackpad), and is only marginally thicker?|some fag on gizmodo}}

{{quote|I don't see why everyone's in such a tizz. Yeah it's pricey and yeah it's pretty much sealed off, but I think it's great that Apple aren't afraid to take the risk. At the very least what will come out of it will be progress in general division of making laptops smaller, easier to use (mac os...) and a lot better looking. Their design is far superior to that of the competition's and you can't deny that those specs aren't decent. If you can fit leopard in a "manilla envelope", who cares about the price?

Also, you guys are such [[apple]] [[fanboys]].|Some other fag on gizmodo with lots of money who wants to swallow [[Steve Job's]] [[cum]], and don't afraid of nothing}}
