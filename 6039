{{quote|[[Gentlemen]], it is time that the era of self absorbed egotistical cybermania comes to an end. For far too long we have tolerated the sickening sight of a generation [[verbose|gorging on it's own grotesque glorfication of manufactured nothingness]]. Soon it ends. On Saturday, the first of May, the [[unrealistic expectations|blue crayon scribbles out]] [[Facebook]]''}}

== Origins ==

The plan was first thought of on the 24th of April, 2010, with a suggestion as to the probability of a [[lolwut|DDoS attack on]] [[Facebook]]. [[Anonymous]] took kindly to the idea and decided to humour this impossible task. An [[IRC]] was made, and [[Jewtube]] videos were created, but the plan changed form, and became a way for [[Anonymous]] to [[unwarrented self importance|flex their muscles and show that they are no longer the joke of the internets]].
