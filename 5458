'''Modern Art''' is shit [[crap|crapped]] out by [[User:4J43V4/Art fag|art fags]] like [[Daniel Plemmons|Daniel Plemmons]] who you can find on [[devianTART|Deviant Art]], and their [[crap|art works]] are full of [[lulz|lulz]] and [[fail|epic fail]]. Often times, the [[emo|artists]] would paint while [[cutting|cutting]] themselves because they know they are talentless posers but yet they still try to convince themselves otherwise. Modern Artists would then try to justify their art work in [[wut|25 page essays]] on [[shit nobody cares about|metaphysics and the meaning of existence]] despite the fact that his work is just [[crap|white paint on white canvas]]. Modern Artists think abstract art and non-representational art are teh shit. But it doesn't matter anyway because the art fags eventually [[suicide|kill themselves]] and [[retard|people who are baffled by modern art]] [[attention whore|worship the paintings just so people wont think they are shallow]]. That is why we have [[comic|comics]] and [[video games|video games]] to replace [[shit|things]] made by [[basement dwellers|them]].

==[[shit nobody cares about|History]]==
===The Beginning from [[at least 100 years ago|19th century to early 20th century]]===
New art styles developed during the late [[at least 100 years ago|19th century]] which tried to [[butthurt|break away]] from the [[gentlemen|traditional styles in Europe]]. Artists like [[emo|Vincent Van Gogh]], a retarded art fag who cut off his ear, pioneered the rise of Modern Art. Of course, styles like Cubism became huge, mainly because [[retard|people thought it was special]] and eventually other [[you|talentless people]] began to [[poser|copy it]]. After a while, people began to [[too lazy|simplify]] the forms to the point that they were abstract and [[wut|no one can tell what the fuck it is]]. Artists like Pablo Picasso pioneered the style of cubism which would eventually influence art fags like Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns of the Abstract Expressionist and Pop Art era.

===Late 20th century to today===

[[Image:File-Robert Rauschenberg's untitled 'combine', 1963.jpg|thumb|left|looks like someone is [[fail|running out of ideas here]], [[amirite|hmm]]?]]
[[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|A huge array of styles]] exploded after [[World War II|WWII]] like Abstract Expressionism, Color Field Painting, Pop Art, Op Art, Minimalist Art, and Post Minimalism, and Photorealism: but they are all the same crap [[amirite|amirite]]?

==Types of Modern Art==
Over the course of history, there has been many styles of Modern Art, all of which sucks badly.

===Minimalism===
'''Minimalism''' is a style of Modern Art where the artist uses the most [[too lazy|simplistic]] shapes, colors, and materials to create [[crap|artwork]] that are so redundantly boring that you feel like you need to gouge your eyeballs out and sear the sockets with a curling iron. [[angst|Angsty]] artists like [[art fag|Mark Rothko]] belonged to this shit genre and eventually killed himself because he got depressed just by looking at his talentless color field paintings. [[common knowledge|Apparently]], he was so [[Verbose Thread|prolific]] that there are [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9000]] of his [[shit|paintings]] worldwide.

===Fauvism===
[[Image:Reclining nude.jpg|thumb|left|lol and [[you|you]] thought that you can't draw]]
If you could take a [[hippy|hippy]] and tell him to paint something, it would be this, a [[crap|faux-vist]] piece. The colors are so [[drug|LSD]] bright that you feel like all [[homosexual|teh gayness]] of the world is upon you and then you wake up [[butthurt|butthurt]] from the [[rape|day before]]. Henri Matisse, who has been reincarnated as Daniel Plemmons, was the original founder of the style. He [[troll|screwed]] over all the other artists before him just because he [[moralfag|thinks so highly of himself]] and acts as if he the [[Nancy Pelosi|queen bitch of the Louvre]].

===Expressionism===
[[Image:Eye Opener.jpg|thumb|Now that's eye opening art for [[emo|emos]].]]
'''Expressionism''' is art created by [[emo|emos]] because they want to [[wut|distort reality for an emotional effect]] as a [[wut|subjective art form]]. These [[artfag|art fags]] are perhaps the most [[angst|angsty]] [[13 year old boy|13 year old boys]] of the art world. The philospher Nietzche helped define this genre of [[shit nobody cares about|art and literature]], but [[truth|everyone knows]] that only emos, [[liberal|liberal]] [[homosexual|fags]], and [[13 year old boy|13 year old boys]] [[fail|read his books]].

===Abstract Expressionism===
This was the first [[The Jewnited States of Americunts|American]] art movement that achieved worldwide influence. Abstract Expressionism was influenced by predecessors like Surrealism and German Expressionism. The term was [[At least 100 years ago|first]] used to describe Wassily Kandinskys paintings, but eventually incorporated "action" painting by Jackson Pollock, and many others. Since the subject matters were abstract and easy for [[Newbie|N00bs]] to learn, it became a safe strategy for [[art fag|art fags]] to strike it rich like a Jew.

==How to Make Modern Art==
There are Many formulas for making modern art, but that's all good cuz dat just adds moar lulz.

===The Emo Way===
Perhaps the more common type of Modern Art among high school students, especially the fat [[16-year old girl|16-year old]] [[attention whores]].

#Get a white canvas
#[[cutting|Take a razor and place it against your wrist]]
#[[Do it faggot]]
#[[????]]
#Profit

===Philosophical===
Shit is Crap just like how Crap is Shit; except in this case Modern Art is interchangeable with either one of the w3rds.

#Get something strange to paint on
#Pull Down Pants
#[[????]]
#Profit
