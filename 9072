Wikiversity
[[Image:VandalismShrine.jpg|thumb|left|Wikiversity does not [[penis|erect]] shrines for [[trolling|vandals]], whereas ED [[grawp|definitely does]].]]

[http://en.wikiversity.org/ Wikiversity] is another long, writhing tentacle of [[TOW]]. It was created to cater to [[fags|frat boys]] and their interests, which mostly include [[circle jerk]]s and other forms of [[unwarrented self-importance|mutual masturbation]], particularly the textual kind. This is not, however, gay, since the balls don't touch.
It's former overlord was missy Ottava Rima who graduated from the awesome wikipedo university, she was suspended on wikipedia for not being civil[http://www.google.co.uk/gwt/x?site=universal&q=wikiversity+administrator&hl=en-GB&resnum=4&ei=bHgKTPiNGKaOMoXa4rwD&sa=X&oi=blended&ct=res&cd=4&ved=0CA4QFjAD&source=m&rd=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwikipediareview.com%2Fblog%2F20100406%2Fwikiversity-when-breaching-experiments-attack%2F], that is, she did not engage in multiple pedo gangbang activities as required by sick wikipedo wikidiot law.


==Drama==

[[Last Thursday]] a number of [[banned|former]] Wikipedia users created a project on Wikiversity called ''"The Ethics of Breaching Experiments"''. It was basically a study on [[Win|vandalising Wikipedia]]. When sole flounder [[Jimbo]] found out about this he deleted the project and blocked the users involved he also desysoped a user that undid Jimbo's blocks. Jimbo used his global [[sysops]] superpowers to do this as he wasn't a contributor to Wikiversity. When everyone on Wikiversity [[Aspie|sperged out]] over Jimbo's actions, he threatened to convince the Wikimedia board to close down Wikiversity. Jimbo basically told the Wikiversity [[luser]]s "[[ITG|Respect mah authoritah]]!"

{{tinyquote|1=I am currently discussing the closure of Wikiversity with the board. That is an unlikely outcome, but I mention it because I really want to press the point that the scope of Wikiversity has to be restricted to genuine OER. I think that my actions here are strongly supportive of the genuine community who want to do that, making it clear to them that they have very strong support for making it happen. Some may feel that Wikiversity should be a place for silly and juvenile experimentation. If people want to discuss such things, there is an entire Internet open to them - they should not hijack Wikiversity for these purposes.|2=[[Jimbo Wales]] 14:49, 13 March 2010 (UTC) }}

===Jimbo Backtracks===

After several days of discussion with the aspies of Wikiversity, Jimbo finally realized that Wikiversitians didn't like him showing up and swinging his banhammer around. Jimbo also didn't get any support from his flunkies as they were all busy on Wikipedia banning Wikipedos while [[masturbating]] with 3 cucumbers up their asses. He resysoped the user he desysoped.

{{tinyquote|1=Ok, I am resysopping you now, but please do not undelete the pages and absolutely please do not unblock either of them. Privatemusings and I are having an email discussion which is reasonably productive.|2=[[Jimbo Wales]] 16:06, 21 March 2010 (UTC)|3=[http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SB_Johnny&curid=73542&diff=547111&oldid=546310 sauce]}}

===Jimbo almost loses his founder rights===

On [http://meta.wikimedia.org Meta] (a sort of wikipedia of all the wikipedias) someone started a [[clusterfuck|Request for Comment]] to remove Jimbo's "founder" privileges arguing that Jimbo disrupted and discredit Wikiversity.[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Remove_Founder_flag] This time Jimbo's [[anti-lulz]] lackeys were out in full force to try to save him from [[ruin]].

====Argument for removal of Jimbo's privileges====

{{tinyquote|Columbus founded the European settlment of Hispaniola. Yet he was such a poor administrator there, [[raep|abusing]] so many people (including his former shipmates), that they finally sent him back to Spain in chains. And no more did they put up with his poor people-management after that, either. They let him make a fourth voyage of discovery, but recognized that people honored as navigators aren't necessarily very good at nitty-gritty government. Sorry. Sbharris 00:29, 27 March 2010 (UTC)}}

====Argument against removal of Jimbo's privileges====

{{tinyquote|If you want someone to make a video about [[Internet Humanitarianism|giving the laptops to 3rd world kids with Wikipedia 1.0 installed]], who does the commentary? Who goes around giving lectures and gathering donations to keep the sites alive? Go and tell those [[Internet Humanitarianism|kids]] and those [[Idiot|investors]] that the guy who made and promotes the sites got removed of all privelidge because he stopped someone for messing. [[bawww|Kick him out and close the door]] while you all formulate a circular about "[[For great justice|How we laid down the law to the last of the depreciated founders.]]" They will love that over on [[ZOO: The Movie|Wikiversity The Movie]] (and I'm not messing go and see). [[lolwut|Most people will not read this or will claim that they didn't understand any of it but that's just the way that some people rattle on. It was a matter of superseding neglect which is all that is so far offered by Meta and WV in the matter]]. [[bawww|Well done]].~ [[faggot|R.T.G]] 01:52, 27 March}}

==Trollin' Potential==

Wikiversity [[Do i have potential|has potential]] for delicious [[lulz]]. Whilst [[Wikipedia]] has a strict no [[original research]] policy, Wikiversity on the other hand welcomes original research (much like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]) as long as it's framed as a genuine research project. Moreover, as seen above, Wikiversitans generally frown upon new research projects getting summary deleted so they will have a deletion discussion thus generating even more lulz. So go ahead and create an research project on your favorite [[truth|whackjob conspiracy theory]]! You could even create a research project on how [[Jews did WTC]], [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=WTC_demolition_theories_involving_Jews_or_Israel&action=edit GOGOGOGOGOGOGO!]
