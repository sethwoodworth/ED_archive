'''You Sir, are and idiot :)''' is the [[McDonald's]] of [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/]]: hot,  fast and ready to be smeared across the interbutts like so much AIDS-tinged [[santorum]]. It is a simple bit of [[copypasta]] used by first by [[Anontalk.com]] spambots, but later [[Rape|adopted]] by [[Newfags]] to respond to a post they not disagree with, but rather merely happen to see when they alt-tab back to /b/ from their [[AnonTalk|CP du jour]]. The OP is [[Butthurt|typically filled with extreme, Godlike fury at the newfag]], but really, it was probably just [[You Laugh You Lose]] again.

== The Cancer in Action ==
"You Sir..." is [[Some Argue|arguably]] the most glaring and malignant symptom of the [[The Cancer That Is Killing /b/|Teh Cancer]]; not only can it be seen quite often on the front page, it will sometimes latch onto the rare and elusive [[Lie|non-shitty]] threads like [[Chris-Chan]] on an attractive store clerk. It usually manifests itself as follows
*Prima: ITT: [[Tubgirl|Orange Juice and its uses]]
*Secunda: You Sir, Are And Idiot :)
When hunting for this cancer, pay attention to the timestamp. [[Truth|9 out of 10 times]] it will be posted seconds after the original posting.

== How To Win Enemies and Infuriate Aspies ==
#Go to /b/
#Click Reply on the first thread you see. Think fast, [[DO IT FAGGOT|no dawdling]].
#Type "You Sir, Are And Idiot" and add whatever smiley you wish to the end. Hit Reply and resume [[sick fuck|fapping.]]
#[[????]]
#[[PROFIT]]!

== What you can do ==
Before you post this shitty meme to /b/, note that now it will get you banned for 3 days. Other than that, not much can be done about it. [[Sage]] is useless most times, and [[STFU]] is like [[Eunuch|firing blanks]]. Really, all [[you]] can do to combat this is to not be a faggot when you reply to posts in /b/.

Better yet, [[Protip|don't read /b/ at all]]
