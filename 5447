{{aspergers}}
'''Mix Hyena''' is a whiny [[furry]] douchebag who defies stereotypes by being grotesquely thin instead of grotesquely [[fat]]. Mix exists in such a constant state of [[butthurt]] that even other [[Sema_JayHawk|furries]] can’t stand him, but it's not his fault because he has [[Assburgers]] and thus free license to be a [[tard]]. Because of his handicap, Mix gets to [http://community.livejournal.com/drama_awesome/103564.html?thread=2645388#t2645388 live rent-free with his furfag friends] and they're not allowed to complain because that would be [[fursecution]].

==Mix trolls a convention==
[[Image:failcave.jpg|thumb|Mix lives here.]]
Mix tried to troll famous furry convention Fuckyifforgy 5000 [[IRL]] by wearing a 
"[[Something Awful]]" shirt and yelling "SOMETHINGAWFUL DOT COM." He wants to be a [[Something Awful]] goon because he thinks that it's still 2002 and that Something Awful is still funny, but he can't because he is a furry and, as such, a failure in everything he attempts.

Amazingly, the furries did not explode in drama at his appearance, but instead pretty much ignored him. Internet master debater Xydexx had this to say: "To be honest, I didn't think he was doing anything really malicious. I mean, he gave me an I <3 VCL button. That was kinda nice. The worst he did at AC was exercise poor judgment, that's all. Everyone makes mistakes." Thus, Mix has the distinction of being the only person ever to fail in an attempt to [[troll]] furries.

== Irrefutable Evidence of Mix's Faggotry ==

*He wrote his own WikiFur page, as evidenced by the fact that it's full of irrelevant bullshit about Mix’s thoughts on religion and other [[shit nobody cares about]].
*He locked his own WikiFur page.  Fag.

[18:52] <Mix> Not into that.
[18:52] <Mix> My friends are Jewish, and I don't wish to be a racist.
[18:52] <Mix> My Grandpop got murdered in a camp.
[18:54] <Mix> Are you a racist?
[18:55] <Jewbacca> totally.
[18:55] <Mix> Sorry to hear that.

== Mix Hates This Article ==
[[Image:Mix irl.jpg|thumb|Mix, in the midst of a pretty rough [[Pro-Ana|purging session]].]]
<pre>
[21:06] <Mix> Well, everything is a lie in that article. And badly worded at that.
[21:06] <weev> ...
[21:06] <weev> WHAT ARTICLE
[21:06] <Mix> http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Mix_Hyena
[21:06] <weev> OKAY
[21:06] <weev> NOW WE ARE GETTING SOMEWHERE
[21:06] <Mix> sorry
[21:06] <weev> okay
[21:07] <weev> so what would you like us to do about it?
[21:07] <Mix> Have the page locked, and/or purged.
</pre>

If there is one thing this guy knows about, it's purging. Lawl.

==Mix's Hatred for Christians and His Beliefs in Polar Energy==
[[Image:polar.jpg|thumb|Powered by polar energy]]
"Mix has stated that he has issues with organized [[religion]], most notably [[Christianity]]. His hatred towards all religion has had him to believe in a philosophy of spirits and polar energy, though still open-minded towards all other philosophical debates. He then relates his own philosophy to transformations and physical shifting, though he has his doubts."

OLOLOL

==Mix's Scritchbook==

Mix is also known for his "sketchbook" retardation.  The sketchbook is the true window to a furry’s soul, a magical tome that a furry carries with him everywhere so that he can cajole artists into drawing free pictures of his true hermaphrodite-fox-wolf-dragon-taur murrrrrsona in it.  

Mix claims to have "a knack for his sketchbook, stating that no one may draw in it if they intend to 'sign' their work."  First, the idiot has misused the word "knack," but what do you expect from a furry?  Mix’s plan to deny artists credit for their work under the guise of preserving the purity of the art does not sit well with most artists, especially since the real purpose behind the NO SIGNATURE rule is much more sinister: [http://community.livejournal.com/artists_beware/54917.html ART THEFT DUN DUN DUN DUUUUN]. Also, if an artist signs anything in Mix's book, he will [http://jilduck.livejournal.com/88040.html cry] the tears of a clown and threaten IRL suicide. 

Mix says, "Artwork is supposed to capture a person's soul/spirit, not their signature. The signatures make the work abstract in appearance."
  
LOL FAG

==Current Shit==

Mix deleted his LiveJournal, and is apparently living anywhere in Chicago or Cleveland.
