UTorrent
[[Image:UTorrent1.png|thumb|"Failing tickles!"]]
µTorrent (pronounced "micro-torrent" for mathematicians, "mu-torrent" for [[Greeks]], and "U-torrent" for [[You|illiterates]]), is [[a plus|the best]] [[bittorrent]] client [[evar]] both due to its efficiency and rich [[lulz]] deposits.

Also, for the [[nerd|computer geeks]] out there, uTorrent is well known for having a [[shit nobody cares about|light systems footprint, stable builds, and easy to use interface.]]

It was bought [[last thursday]] by bittorrent inc., which in turn has been bought by some [[asshole]]s who have [[rape]]d [[at least 100]] [[13 year old boys]]. No one has yet been able to find any [[fact|real]] [[proof]] that µTorrent actually reports any informations about your activity to the [[rapists|bad guys]], but that doesn't stop [[retard]]s from going [[batshit crazy]] and having a [[hissy fit]] when they see somebody using any version of µTorrent that has been released later than [[at least 100 years ago]].

Some [[idiot|overminds]] also like to point out that µTorrent no longer reports downloading pieces that failed hash checks because "its gona screw our cheeturs detectionz". Nevermind the fact that [[Azureus]], the [[retard]]ed [[fish]] [[frog]] of a [[bittorrent]] client written entirely in [[java]] ([[fail]] [[Ren Fest|manifest]]), making it completely useless for anybody with less than 100GB of RAM and a [[Quasidan|quad]]-core, has been doing it for [[at least 100]] years, and [[Nobody gives a shit|no one cared]]. This is probably due to the fact that using Azureus is a [[banhammer|bannable]] offence in itself, so detecting whether the person using it is a cheater or not is pointless.
[[Image:UTorrent2.png|thumb|I have a completely [[bullshit]] [[opinion]]. [[You]] [[Believe everything you read|should read it]].]]

[[PROTIP]]: for instant drama, start a thread on any tracker's forum about how µTorrent should be banned if it's allowed or how it should be allowed if it's banned. Try to make it offensive enough to enflame idiots, but not too much so you don't get banned right away. Best targets are [[porn]] trackers or [[whore|moneymaking]] trackers (think bitsoup.org). Alternatively, shoot at it until it dies.

To escalate drama say you've conducted some research on that matter and have indusputable proof that your baseless opinion is correct. If somebody demands to see your proof - ignore them. Extra [[Man points|troll points]] if you mention wireshark.

According to [[teh]] [[internets]] [[luser]] '''hihi''', µTorrent developers employed [[l33t]] [[h4x0r]]s who apparently took [[over 9000|Computer Science 9000]] and/or/xor [[Computer Science III|Computer Science Infinity]] to [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/Virginia_Tech_massacre#Facebook.27s_Greatest_Quotes hack your internet protocol address] [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/d/d4/UTorrent2.png]
