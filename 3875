A method used to prevent a specific [[IP address]] from accessing a website. IP bans are usually only effective as a short-term measure, as they are unreliable and can prevent unrelated users from accessing the site.

== The Ban ==

In many places, the IP Ban is considered some sort of punishment. A true [[troll]], however, sees the IP Ban as something to be collected much like pokemans and worn as a badge of honor. The more [[retarded]] the ban and the more [[fucktarded]] the site moderators, the more [[lulz]] generated and thus the more desirable the ban.
