'''David Gonterman'''Jew, also known as ''Daveykins'' (as his [[Mary Sue|female]] [[unrealistic expectations|wish fulfillment]] characters call him) is the self-described "[[Internets]] most dangerous [[comic|cartoonist]]." In reality, he's a middle-aged (40 years old as of 2010) whiny [[furry]] with a [[fursecution|persecution complex]].

DaveyKins is immediately identifiable by his cross-eyed characters, his artistic inability to distinguish between male and female bodies, his rampant self-insertion, his censorship of the swears he himself decided to include in his works, his brilliant use of literal words for sound effects, and constant use of his favorite made up word: 'phracking'. David really likes the word "Foxfire", and uses it as his "studio" name and his imaginary surname. He was planning to write a book exposing the evil that is [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], but like most of his projects, he appears to have lost interest because [[ADHD|somebody jangled keys in front of him]] or something.

He used to be a reliable [[lolcow]], but after 14 years of being told he's shit, it seems even he started believing it. He now makes fun of himself and will actually take suggestions on how to (relatively) "improve" his work. Despite his intentions, this only comes across as the anguished moans of a broken man who finally had his soul crushed.

[[Image:Lost_Boy_Found_Official_Cover_by_DaveykinsFoxFire.jpg|thumb|The final cover art of his "novel" that no publisher could possibly refuse. Is his pen name really "Daveykins Foxfire"?]]
David Gonterman started drawing comics and writing [[fanfic]]s [[at least 100 years ago]], and every single one will inevitably star a self-insert [[Mary Sue]] of DaveyKins himself. Seeming to finally realize that his drawings are horrendously bad, DaveyKins has taken to thinking he may be more [[Unrealistic Expectations|successful as a writer.]] In this he is very mistaken.


{{cs2|DK1|Lost Boy Found|
Daveykins has recently self-published his first novel, [http://lostboyfound.foxfirestudios.net/ "Lost Boy Found"], which from his "cover art" clearly infringes on the copyrights of Disney. Moreover, the book's Peter Pan/Neverland discourse puts him right into [[Childlove|Michael Jackson territory]].  He called on all his many fans to help him proofread it and offered free copies for them but he warned [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/journal/11235593/ "You must be willing to help me with the edit, and not just LUL over it like a retard from the Encyclopedia Dramatica."'] The consequences of "LULing" are ominously unspecified but are bound to be [[butthurt|dramatic]]. 
This novel seems to be focused around yet another DaveyKins self-insert who is [[BFF]] to Peter Pan from the Disney films (that he's aware Peter Pan was originally a children's novel written in the early 1900's is questionable) and predictably involves some Japanese bitch and many references to [[animu]].

{{cs2|DK2|Piasa Bird|
His first fic was the ''[http://tinyurl.com/3pnh5g Piasa Bird]'', a Power Rangers story that was once thought lost to the ages but is still available. This story introduces his [[Mary Sue]] character, Davey Crockett, who saves the day from some legendary Native American chimera only to have his arm shot off by a [[female]] [[Negro]] history teacher who hates his lily-white cracka ass. In fact the whole thing seems to have been written thanks to [http://tinyurl.com/DaveykinsNegro a black teacher who gave him an F on a report about race relations]. This would not be surprising as DaveyKins is [[Chris-chan/Sonichu|known to antagonize or kill off those who spurn him in fanfics]], as if it would have any impact on [[irl|real life]].

Throughout the story Davey and his small group of privileged white friends bemoan their hardships in growing up in a "multicultural society" and comment several times on how unreasonable people of other races are. And apparently the [[nigra]]s of the city continue to riot about some policemen beating a doped-up black man with night-sticks while a giant bird leopard dinosaur thing is destroying everything around them. It's supposedly narrated by "Zack" from the Power Rangers, I.E. the black one, whom DaveyKins apparently believes is extremely self-loathing. It also implies DaveyKins believes any black person anywhere would want to hang out with his honky ass. [[Serious]]ly. If ''only'' we could make up something this fucking [[lulz]]y.

Piasa
                                
a modern-day retelling
of a Native American legend
                                
By David Gonterman
                                
as told by Zack, formerly of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
                                
Period 1 of
The Orange Ranger Trilogy

Directions for Reading:
For best results, get Blood and Metal I with this file, and begin reading that file immediately after finishing this one.  This is BAM's prequel and flows seamlessly into themain story.
The story is placed in the Power Rangers Command Center.  You will see it from the viewing globe as do the assembled [current] Power Rangers.  The text comes from Zack's report of the incident....

A bronze statue of a young man holding a double-barreled sawed-off shotgun standsbefore what used to be the Piasa Bird monument at the Alton cliffs.  The dude who that statue was made after stands before it, only he had a robotic left arm in place of the real one he lost in his modern-day battle with this creature from Native American legend.  But the wacked part 
is that it wasn't the Piasa Bird that removed his real left arm, but the ethnic strife in the area that woke it up.  I should know, I was around him 
when it happened.

The Piasa Bird is a legend students in St. Louis history get to know early.  It was about a monster resembling a jaguar with wings and a tail long enough to do laps around the body.  400 years ago, this over-glorified canary showed up one day, and began snacking on the natives, until a brave warrior and six of his friends fought it off.  The bird disappeared into the Alton cliffs and was never heard from again until a few weeks back, around the time that a racial riot that resembled the Rodney King incident broke 
out around here.  What set it off was really predictable if you keep up to date in politics today, like my friend Jason does:

Two white cops had to use their night-sticks to stop a black gang-banger on PCP.  The cops were tried but they were found innocent.  The black community started to protest in the streets.  The media did their spin on the whole thing.  The Republican-controlled congress in Washington went on TV and warned people not to riot like the people in South Central did.  One person got up and shouted something about a lack of compassion, or some other Politically Correct phrase.  One thing led to another, and before 
anyone knew it, there was fighting in the streets, burning cars, and all-around rioting and looting in the heartland.

The part I don't get is that, if the main argument was black-vs-white, why did other ethnic groups had to get involved?  Like why did some PC Thought Police idiot group picket the world opening of Disney's newest flick, 'Pocahontas?'  What were they to gain by saying that a harmless movie is bad history?  I mean,  I have seen this film with my friends and none of us found anything wrong with it.  Everybody was surprised to find a balanced image between Powahatan Tribe and the English Explorers, but that's 
getting out of the subject. 

This is where our cyborg friend comes in, only he's not a cyborg yet; that comes later.

Our hero's name's Davey Crockett, a college student, aspiring artist, and chronic daydreamer.  You'll won't know him, he's not the sociable type.  My--ahem--sources tell me that he got a case of mental illness several years after high school; I guess that if you get nagged by your parents day in and day out to get a job that just ain't there in the real world, you'll sink into depression too.  He's been doing okay now with counseling and Prosac up to the point where the PC mob at the theater caught him talking with me, Jason and Trini over the movie.

Man, it was a miracle that Davey got all four of us in his car and got 
away before they tried to scalp him, or whatever they had in their sick 
little minds for rednecks from the Metro East side of the Mississippi River.  
He didn't stop ‘til he got to his apartment in Granite City, where we 
decide to hide themselves in for the night; have a party too while were 
here.

Eventually, we all got close enough to tell each other our experience 
in trying to live in a Multicultural society.  Although none of us will 
admit actually hating another group, there was a moment of two in each of 
our lives that race relations rubbed us the wrong way.  For example, Davey 
had an African-American history teacher with way too much attitude last 
fall, who got up in front of the whole class and called him a racist to his 
face, only because he was sick and tired of having the slavery issue rubbed 
in his face like a bad dog that wet the bed.  I said that she was full of 
B.S., and that he was definitely not racist in saying that.  Angry, yes, but 
not oficcialy racist.  Besides,  my mother told me that it's just not right 
to visit the sins of the fathers onto their children.  However, the question 
over Davey's feelings toward Multicultuarism will crop up to haunt him later 
in this story. 

The next morning we went outside to hear people talking about how the 
earthquake was like.  We didn't feel any quaking except for a train speeding 
by Davey's backyard now and then.  Little did we know that one of those 
faint rumblings didn't come from any train.

"We didn't have the TV on then," I said.  "We don't know about any 
quake!"
"Must be that New Madrid fault line," Davey added.  "It was about time 
it acted up."
"I'm afraid that it wasn't any fault," one neighbor interjected.  "This 
quake came from some sort of explosion from the Alton Cliffs.  Here's the 
news feed on TV, come look for yourselves."

The cliff looked like the Oklahoma bombers practiced on it.  A giant 
crevice appeared where the metal sculpture of the Piasa Bird once stood, 
spreading fifty feet wide at front and narrowing down some seventy-five feet 
before disappearing into black smoke beyond.  The blast--if it were a 
blast--had not only leveled the visitor's center, which was supposed to be 
directly under the absent cliff, but it also dug a trench that leads into 
the river, pouring water into a dark cave where the smoke came out of.

Limestone was thrown all the way to the Missouri side of the river. It 
completely covered what was left of the road between the river and the 
cliffs, making it unpassable.  Only a brave band of news reporters arrived 
to investigate what they thought was an earthquake.

"Great, just what Alton needs now," Davey quipped in the usual smart-
alec manner when faceing things he has no control over.  "Another natural 
disaster, as if the floods wrecking the cruise schedule of its gambling 
boats weren't bad enough--"

Suddenly a terrifying scream came from inside the cave.  It was so loud 
that it made windshields shatter and the ground to shake.  A gust of wind as 
strong as a hurricane spewed smoke, sulfur, and pieces of rock the size of 
soccer balls out toward the camera knocking it around a few times before 
allowing it to settle on the ground, still facing the cave.  It had a 
perfect view of what came out of that cave.

The first to appear was a billow of flame, streaming out toward the 
water as if it came from a flame thrower, next was the horns, white and 
twisted, each like a twisted gnarled tree in winter.  After that the fangs 
appeared, as large as elephant's tusks, but jutting upward from a severe 
underbite, one on each side of the flame throwing nostrils of its lion-like 
face. At each side, about five feet back, the wings sprang out of the mist.  
Each wing was thirty feet wide and webbed like a bat.  They flapped with a 
force so strongly it uprooted trees as they passed by.  They protruded from 
a white leopard's body.  Fifteen feet long and standing seven feet tall, 
with claws as big as butcher knives.

Finally, snaking out of the cave, appeared the beginning of the tail, 
python green and forked like a snake's tongue at the end.  Eventually that 
tail will measure seventy-five feet by itself, and it was still coming out 
of the cave before the beast came into full view of the helicopter camera, 
but it was no doubt in anyone's minds just what this monster that came from 
the bowels of hell itself was.

"That is the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my whole life!  Don't 
look at him.  You'll turn to stone!"
"Holy!  What on earth is that thing?"
"I know what it is," Davey said.  "My God.  It's the Piasa Bird."

The monster shrieked in rage upon being noticed.  It took off with 
those monstrous wings and went directly for the helicopter camera, its crew 
screaming in horror as it approached.  While the monster attacked the camera 
broke free, and everyone who watched got to see the Piasa Bird feast on the 
helicopter pilot before the camera splashes into the river and sinks into 
white snow.

None of us took long in deciding what to do.  Between Davey's knowledge 
on what this Piasa Bird was about, and the rest of us wanting to keep St. 
Louis safe from this local version of Godzilla, we've decided to destroy 
this creature, or at least put it back to sleep for another 400 years.  The 
only question on our minds is how that thing woke up. Trini said that the 
inability for everybody to just get along got whoever counts as the Great 
Spirit pissed off and woke the creature.  A neighbor who was heavy into New 
Age said that all the negative vibes that we all were giving off that woke 
it up from its slumber.  Davey only said that it woke up from all the noise.  
Whatever.  The point is that we have a jaguar with wings and a tail that 
can do three laps around the body trashing St. Louis like a Japanese monster 
movie, and unless you count us, there was not a Power Ranger in sight.  Oh, 
hell.  No rest for the wicked, I guess.

We did most of our homework while everything was going to heck on the 
news.  We got a printout of the Piasa Bird legend, and read it for clues.  
>From the legend, we learned that 'Tweety' here is supposed to have a thick 
hide, almost like chain mail on medieval suits of armor, but it had a weak 
spot directly underneath the wings.

"That's okay is you're throwing spears at it," Davey noted, "but today 
we've got weaponry that will cut through that like a hot knife through 
butter."
"Yo, Genius," I said, "did we have to print this out to learn this?"
"We'll have that advantage," Davey responded.  "We just have to find 
the Power Blaster to feed it with."

We couldn't find the Power Blaster.  We did find enough guns and rifles 
to arm a small malitia, with a small fortune on armor piercing bullets, 
hollow tips, Black Talons, and many other illegal ammo that'll kick some 
butt.  We also found a bulletproof vest for each of us.  All this while 
dodging a riot that was still going on--you'd think that a bunch of inner 
city people will have enough sense to stop this "No Justice, No Peace" crap 
and duck inside their homes when a monster starts trashing their 
neighborhood!  Sheesh!  This would be a whole lot easier is we were in the 
good-old rainbow-colored spandex.  One problem, though: What color would 
Davey be?

Now, this is when things really start going crazy.  Davey Crockett is 
not one prone to risk life or limb.  I don't think that he had something to 
prove to me, Trini or Jason, or this city, especially when his hometowm 
thinks he's a nerd.  Yet, he said that he had something to prove to himself 
when he volunteered to stand alone in full view on top of the tallest 
skyscraper in the city, while Jason, Trini, myself, and several other 
volunteers were waiting in the wings to blind side the Piasa Bird when it 
comes for him.  He said that he wanted to be someone that other Angry White 
Men can look up to; someone who is more then just a racist, sexist, 
homophobic, well, you know.

"I don't think that is the reason you're doing this," Trini said to 
him.  "I think you have some Native American in you, Davey.  If it isn't 
from your bloodline, you probably picked it up somehow."
"Ah read many stories from them," Davey replied.  "I know some of the 
Native American mythology.  But I'm afraid I'm not as serious about it as 
you are, though."
"I can't imagine why," she answered with a wink as she got into 
position.  "They're serious about you.  You'll see."

It was at the last light of sunset when the Piasa Bird streaked from 
the western horizon.  It strafed the treetops with the speed of a jet as it 
approached St. Louis.  There was not a light in the skyline except for the 
spotlights poised at the top of the tallest building, which was where it saw 
his next victim.  With a shriek of delight, it picked up speed and attitude 
to take his prey head on.  If it could notice, it would find out that its 
target for the night had on a bullet proof vest and an eagle feather tied 
to his SIUE cap.  It would also see that his target, named Davey 
Crockett--as if it cared--was holding a sawed-off shotgun aimed directly at 
its head.

"All right, pal," Davey shouted.  "What's on your mind?"
Davey waited until both him and the Piasa Bird can see their 
reflections in each other's eyes before he pulled the trigger.  It was 
nothing short of awe-inspiring.  I thought, Zordon, put this guy in the 
Power Rangers now!!!

The Piasa Bird did a back flip in midair before landing before Davey, 
and then, looking him square in the eyes, swallowed the buckshot he fed 
into its mouth.

"Crud," Davey cursed.  "Bad idea."
The Piasa Bird pounced out for Davey, but at the last moment, he 
sidestepped out of the way of the talons and opened fire at it some more, 
setting it up for the rest of us to open fire at the sides.  Some bullets 
bounced off the hide, some manage to intrude themselves between the scales, 
but others found the weak spot; the area under the wings that was 
unprotected.

With an agonizing scream that shattered the glass windows of that 
skyscraper, the Piasa Bird did another loop and plunged into the dark 
streets below.  Davey watched the monster fall as long as he dared before 
vertigo overtook him.  After a few tense seconds he turned to us and 
triumphantly cried out, "We did it!"

Without warning, and I would say on a cue, the Piasa Bird appeared out 
of the darkness below, snatched Davey up by the talons, and carried him off 
the scyscraper! Fortunately, the vest kept him from being impaled by the 
sharp talons.  Even so, he was hanging from the Piasa Bird by its talons, 
nearly blacking out from the loops, twists, and spins it performed.  He ran 
out of ammo in his shotgun, so he had to throw it away and reach for a 
handgun that he had in his belt.  Davey aimed carefully for the chin of his 
captor, and what seened like an eternity trying to aim, he fired one Black 
Talon right up the Piasa Bird's chin.

The Piasa Bird's head exploded in a burst of blood, brain, and bone.  
(Dang, No wonder Black Talons are illegal!!!)  It fell like a rock 
immediately, with Davey along for the express ride to the streets below.

I couldn't look to see the landing.  I was too busy taking the 
elevator--it was safer than Davey's method of reaching Ground Floor--to find 
whatever was left of the Piasa Bird . . . and Davey.

We were almost at the place where they landed when we could hear Davey 
say, "Aw, Crud, it's you."  Then we heard a gunshot.  This is where that 
incident with that Black History Teacher comes into play, because It was she 
that shot off his left arm, with the same gun used on the Piasa Bird.  Yes, 
with the same type of bullett too.

I was immediately pissed off at that woman for what she did.  Davey 
Crockett saved his city and this is how they thank him?  I tackled that 
witch to the ground and asked her why.  She said something about getting 
back at his ancestors for what they did to her ancestors.  I would've killed 
her if Jason hadn't pried me off.

I was still angry over Davey's condition though.  I would rather see 
him dead than having him wake up with a good excuse to join the Klan.  I 
mean, he had a future with that left arm.  He was going to college to get 
an art degree.  He was going to make something for himself, something nobody 
expected him to do.  I went everywhere  defending his case; It just wasn't 
fair.

Fortunately, I got heard.  Somehow--I believe it was Zordon--made a 
state-of-the-art cyborg left arm for Davey.  This one was special; it had a 
compartment in the lower arm with more gadgets than a Swiss Army Knife.  He 
must've made it so that he woke up from the operation with that arm attached 
to him.  He heard the mayor of St. Louis right above.  "We did wrong to you, 
son," he said.  "I won't blame you for hating us black's for the rest of your
life."  I held my breath for the worst.

Davey just smiled at him had gave him the thumbs up sign.  I couldn't 
believe it.  I just broke down crying.  This guy's a regular prince.  He 
said that it was okay, the city was safe, the riot was stopped, and the 
woman that shot off his arm's facing justice.  That's all he wanted.  Davey 
Crockett's a regular hero.  He didn't need no stinking spandex, know any 
martial arts, or even have a Zord.  Although now with that cyborg arm, he's 
his own mech now.  Forget the Power Rangers, We've got Davey Crocket--King 
of the Cyber frointier!

They made that bronze statue of him in honor of that night, and placed 
it in front of the demolished Piasa Bird exhibit.  They plan on 
reconstructing the place and put in another museum to hold the now two 
legends of the Piasa Bird.  But for now, people just drop by the statue and 
admire what Davey did.  Even Davey himself stands in front of that statue 
and thinks over what he did.  He would have stood there forever if I havent 
yanked at him to "Let's go."

Where, you ask?  Onwards.  Place to go, people to see, and adventures 
to have, although none as dangerous as that Piasa Bird.  Davey plans to 
return to college to complete his degree, then move to Angel Grove to 
persue a career.  I wish him well. And Zordon, If you're reading this, I 
would like to thank you for what you did to Davey.  May the power potect 
him.  May the power protect us all.

Bridge:
----


Place: Power Rangers Command Center
Cast: All six current Power Rangers (Adam, Aiesha, Billy, Kimberly, Rocky, 
and Tommy), Alpha 5, and Zordon.
Time: Immediately after Zack finished his Piasa report.

Zordon: I wish I could take the credit for Davey's recovery, Zack, but I 
cannot.

Rocky: You mean you didn't give him his metal arm?

Zordon nods no.

Alpha: AiYiYiYi!  Something's wrong with Mr. Crockett!!

Rocky: That must be his robot arm, Alpha.

Alpha: It's not that at all!  Check out these readings!!

Billy: Let me see those. . . . Davey Crockett. . . . Age: Physically, 26.  
Chronologically. . . I don't believe it. . . 102.

All: 102!?!

Billy: How can he be 76 years older than he 

An alarm sounds. 

Alpha: And that's not all.  I've just detected a disturbance in 
the time-space continuum.  I'm not sure, but I think it's connected to 
Davey somehow. 

Billy taps on a keyboard: Affirmative.  The subspace disturbance 
occurred last night, in the exact spot where Davey laid in a coma. 

Zordon: I think I know what happened to him: While Davey 
Crockett's body was comatose in this dimension, his mind must be displaced 
in another dimension.  There, he must have lived an entire life, in the 
span of eight real-time hours.  I have detected chronal abnormalities like 
this one before. 

Kimberly: Um, can you tap into that dimension Davey was in that 
night? 

Zordon: I can, and I will also monitor his progress there. 

Kimberly: Thanks Zordon. 

Tommy: What's wrong, Aiesha?  You've been quiet all this time. 

Aiesha: Oh, nothing, Tommy. . . It's just. . . Oh, I just feel bad 
for Dave here.  He just lost his arm because of what his ancestors did. . . 
It's just not right. 

Zordon:  I understand your sorrow over the political ramifications 
over his assault, Aiesha, and I am sure that Davey will agree.  This I 
know, because at the end of his 'life' in that dimension he was lost in, I 
helped him return to this one. 

All: You? 

Zordon: Yes, at that time, the racial conflict caused by that 
event plunged your country into a second civil war, destroying everyone, 
even all of you.  Davey can stop that from occurring in this world by 
returning to the present and stop the escalation of racial tensions from 
occurring.  This he done, exceptionally well. 

Aiesha: Cool. 

Adam: So, you think he's Power Ranger potential? 

Kimberly: Oh, get out!  A seventh Power Ranger? 

Rocky: Oh, you think Zordon was handing out raffle tickets. . . 

Adam: Someone's needs to be the Green Ranger now that Tommy's 
vacated it. 

Kimberly: Adam, he uses a shotgun against a giant monster.  Do you 
see any of us use a shotgun against a giant monster? 

Tommy: Besides, he looks like the type who would use that shotgun 
against the putties! 

Zordon: True, but you don't know who gave him that shotgun, of to 
be more accurate, the Power Rifle. 

Kimberly: You?  No.  Him?  A Power Ranger? 

Zordon: Yes and no, Kimberly.  I gave him the Power Rifle, true;   
He needed it to defeat the Piasa Bird, and it proved useful in his 
adventures in that other dimension.  He also has in his possession a Power 
Coin that enabled him to contact me.  But Davey Crockett will not be an 
official Power Ranger, per se.  His role in the battle against evil will 
be a different one that the one you all have chosen, but it is equally as 
important.  He is destined to be a key player in several important events 
in the future, and will require some power of his own in order to win those 
events to the side of good. 

Tommy: So, what's his Power Coin?  And power, I mean? 

Zordon: Mr. Crockett is known for his cunning and quick wit.  I 
have chosen for him the power of the fox.  With his power coin, he can 
operate a small sized morphing grid, which was the prototype of the one 
you Power Rangers use.  He can morph into a fox form, and calI on a 
hovercycle and a jetpack.  His robotic arm has continuous access to the 
Internet, where the majority of his powers reside. 

Kimberly: One more request, Zordon.  Can you show us where he got 
his cyborg arm? 

Zordon: I'm glad you asked, because that event is just about to 
begin in the dimension Davey was in.  Observe the viewing globe. 

Kimberly: Whoa, a talking squirrel.  This is too much. 

Adam: Hey, I think I know what Davey's in.  I seen it in a cartoon 
once. 

Rocky: What's is that called? . . . 
____________________ 

Okay, like I said, go immediately into Blood and Metal, and 
continue the storyline from there.  Okay, I'll allow you to catch your 
breath and get a snack in between the segments, because I'm such a nice

Piasa is the first story in what I'll call "The Orange Ranger 
Trilogy."  It'll sandwitch BAM together, yet by itself, is a riveting 
polital thriller centering around Davey Crockett. 

Period 2 occures 75 years in the future, yet Davey hasn't 
aged a second, as he struggles to find a way back to the present in 
an universe that could only be entitled, "The Age of Zed."  You have 
only one guess who took over.  You know what happened to 8 of the other 
9 Power Rangers.  You don't want to know what happened to the 
ninth--"Dragon Boy," the Green Ranger; the Other Tommy. 

Period 3 costars everybody from Saban--all 10 Power Rangers 
(if you count Davey), the V.R. Troopers, and the new Masked Rider, 
as they battle an political evil that treatens to destroy all of them 
until they snip it in the bud.  It's exciting action mixed with a 
political message of harmony among the races. 

Racism.  It's everybody's problem, now.  Even to White Males.

{{cs2|DK3|Blood and Metal|

[[Image:BloodandmetalDaveyKins.jpg|thumb|left|Blood and mullet!]]His next fanfic was a [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] series called "Blood and Metal". There were [[OVER 9000]] stories in this series such deep and meaningful titles as "Blood and Metal Alpha" and "Blood and Metal Beta."  He supposedly rewrote the whole thing two times after the first publication, showing an obsession with this "moment of glory". For who knows what reason, Davey-kins did enjoy some popularity with this series and most stories are full of cameos of his friends. Some of them went on to write their own crappy stories set in his so-called "universe" and others collaborated with him on stories. The star was not Sonic but his cleverly named Gary Stu "David Kintober" AKA "Davey Crockett" who turned out to be Robotnik's son and everyone was supposed to be shocked that "Kintobor" is "Robotnik" spelled backwards ([[Shit nobody cares about|although in a surprising turn of accuracy, it was something that had been used in the Sonic canon before]]). Throughout the series, he charms the canon characters with his modern slang and all sorts of stupid pop culture references.

"Blood and Metal Alpha" is the only installment that's readily available, which is sad because most of the wanky stuff happens later on. Others are available in zip format [http://www.etext.org/Zines/ASCII/Foxfire here].

"Haunted Fantasies" is arguably the most notable installment if only for the sheer amount of time he spends BAAAWing about his childhood.

"You can say that I was *not exactly* the most popular kid back home."  Davey dropped back to ground level as the two redheads telepathically blocked flying debris. "Let's just say that I was the bottom man on the public school food chain.  A pastor on earth talks about being tried for the charge of being unpopular and proven guilty. And the sentence is loneliness for the rest of your mortal life.  <His voice lowered>  That sure applied to me."

Phenix looked at Suni with concern in her face.  "Teased and taunted all his life.  Treated like a common animal by human beings."

"And *they* are supposed to be higher evolutionary then us."

"They were supposed to be created one notch below angels, ladies.  Unfortunately, they forgot all that."

"Humph.  That's obvious."

Suddenly, a large wooded paddle flied past the two hedgehogs, followed by a screeching woman's voice.  Phenix screeched back.  "Throw a stick at *me* will you?!"  She pushed Suni back inside to Davey's arms as she whipped out her own Power Rifle.

"Phenix, No!  You don't know what it'll do to Davey's--"

"That must be my mother.  After Daddy Dearest fell down the rabbit hole, she wanted to make sure that I don't end up like him. . ."

Phenix shouts.  "YOU SEE *THIS*, BITCH?  THIS IS MY *BABY*!! I CALL HER MY 'PHOENIX FIRE'!!"

"She became overbearing, holding on too tight.  She criticized every damned thing I say and do.  She's try to criticize my *thoughts* if she could . . ."

"I CAN'T SCARF STARS AND FRY THE BAD GUYS LIKE MY X-WOMAN NAMESAKE, SO I USE *THIS* INSTEAD!!"

"My mother nagged me constantly!  Nothing I could do was good enough.  It wasn't just her; I couldn't seem to amount to jack snikt at *anything* in general . . ."

Suni just stood there stunned.  She never heard of this child-bringing at all on Mobius.  It wasn't even considered.  To hedgehogs, foxes, squirrels, and any other critter on Mobius, their parents were always remembered, if they could, as warm and nurturing.  "I just didn't *matter*.  All I was to the world was a whipping boy.  Someone to pin the blame on for everything that was wrong in their eyes."

But this?  This was barbaric to her.  Savage.  Inhumane.

And Davey said that they were one notch below the messengers to the Gods?!

"Go ahead, hon.  Blow her to hell.  I'm tired of her screech!"

Phenix fired a series of shots, each sounding like lightning.  The area outside the wall ignited with starfire. Davey could still hear her mother's shouts of anger as she pulled the trigger a few more times.  Then the high-pitched shrill was drowned out.

"I thought I got rid of all that direct rejection of me when I left my parent's home.  I end up being rejected because of my Redneck upbringing.  I thought I got rid of that when I started College, I end being rejected because of me being a White Male Christian With A German Last Name, and therefore the source of all what's wrong in their so-called 'open' little minds.  I thought I got rid of that when I shot that Piasa Bird dead.  I thought I would be regarded as a hero.  Well?"  He holds out his left arm.

"And then you came here.  To another planet.  Surely you'll be away from it *all*.  You'll won't be thought off by your skin color, or your upbringing.  Surely you can be--"

"Robotnik's eldest son.  Damn.  The Worst Case of Bad Karma on Two Planets.  Now I see what you mean."

Suni was by now sobbing on Davey's shoulder, sorry of her boyfriends lot in life.

"It's nothing I should bother someone else's life with."

"You say that *Now?*"

"It's *my* problem, P.  I don't want it to make it anyone else's."

{{cs2|DK5|Sally Protest|
[[Image:Salp05.gif|thumb|left|DaveyKins offering to get Sally Acorn back into her comic with the power of fictional objects]]
Perhaps the best known of the Gontercomics is the passionate "[http://tinyurl.com/497pwc Sally Protest]". It was penned in an indignant rage when DaveyKins went [[batshit]] because he thought they were killing off [[Mary Sue|uber Sue]] Sally Acorn in the abysmal Archie [[Sonic the Hedgehog]] comics (turns out they copped out saying it was a dream or something, but DaveyKins probably thought he got it changed, thus labeling himself the "Internets Most Dangerous Cartoonist".) He actually whined so much that Archie sent him a copy of the story just to shut him up.

The comic mostly centers around a poorly drawn version of Sally having wild moodswings like a typical [[female|woman]], going between ranting and raving and sobbing hysterically because she's been killed off while DaveyKins's own sue Jonathan Brigsby and some black person named "MechTail" look on. During the course of the comic DaveyKins sees fit to actually compliment people of the Archie team responsible for [[crap]] like the [[shit]]ty Sonic comics and declare that all Marvel and DC comics (except for Image Comics) are garbage.

In the end, Sally Acorn ends up on the desk of the actual David Gonterman who announces that his ANGER over her death gave her NEW LIFE in his FANFICTION UNIVERSE. Sally then burns a bunch of Sonic comics for closure (it's as weird and creepy as it sounds.) This comic is another excellent example of DaveyKins's stunning habit of assigning his own opinions and emotions to other people's characters.

Thought to be one of the earliest Gontercomics (only ceritified Gonterologists would know for sure), [http://tinyurl.com/4z9sge ''Kitsune .44''] weaves the tale of Scott Trucker (a.k.a David Gonterman), a [[Texas]] Ranger who is transported to a feudal [[Japan]] via a tornado or something of that sort. It makes [[Inuyasha]] look like a historical documentary. Even though it is set in like the 16th century people are not alarmed by the fact that "Scott" has a firearm, or the fact that he is a westerner who appeared mysteriously in a time when Japan was closed to the west, or that he shot the first person he saw for no clear reason. Luckily, since the guy he shot was supposedly evil, he is immediately introduced to the Local Lord by a little girl who psychically teaches him Japanese and enjoys [[fursuit]]ing (which DaveyKins apparently believes is what geisha did.) David-er ''Scott'' is then asked to take on the Local Lord's archenemy - none other than dreaded "Tommy Gun Geishu". The comic thankfully peetered out here.

{{cs2|DK7|Sailor Moon USA|
[[Image:Gonterskills.JPG|thumb|left|Sailor Moon commenting on DaveyKins's drawing skill]] Shortly after Sailor Moon was canceled off American TV around 1996 for the first of many times, likely because the syndication distributor realized future seasons contained [[lesbian]]s and [[J-Rock|a transvestite boy band trio]], a then 26 year old DaveyKins (apparently unaware of illegal bootlegs) decided the best way to satiate his desire for more [[jailbait|adolescent]] girls running around in impossibly short skirts battling tentacle monsters and otherworldly [[homosexual]]s was to draw a comic about himself meeting Sailor Moon. [http://www.reocities.com/Vienna/Strasse/5169/p1.htm It only exists now in MST-form], with additions by a slightly more competent artist, and this is something you should be thankful for. 
[[Image:DaveyKins-smusa.jpg|thumb|Even girls in his own comics scream upon finding themselves in DaveyKins's arms]]
The gist of the plot is Japan blows up, somehow propelling Sailor Moon all the fuck way over to Saint Louis somehow without liquefying her body. She's caught by none other than Daveykins, and taken to a hospital. Sailor Moon's stupid talking cat shows up and bestows upon DaveyKins a convenient <s>babelfish</s> earpiece (a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy rip-off) that allows him to hear Sailor Moon's [[Japanese|moon-speak]] as proper God-given English. DaveyKins is somehow allowed to check the strange under aged Japanese girl out of the hospital and take her home without any questions asked, and instantly upon entering DaveyKins's home/studio Sailor Moon begins to tell him at length how he's a better artist than every manga artist EVAR and how she should take him home with her. Did we mention she's attracted to DaveyKins and his mullet? Despite having a tall, handsome, [[pedophile|college-aged]] boyfriend back home? Also that Sailor Moon is fully aware she's from a television show?

DaveyKins and Sailor Moon then get on a video chat, which we all know was pure fucking science fiction in 1996, since Sailor Moon's hero group, despite wanting to keep their identities secret, apparently has a website with a chat on it. The other scouts instantly get all wet under their skirts for DaveyKins's manly mullet and trucker hat, because as we all know Japanese women crave [[superior]] white [[cock]], and decide he's worthy of using some Sailor Mecha Armor or some shit that they were saving for the first man besides Sailor Moon's boyfriend who happened to show up. Luckily from there the rest of the comic imploded in on itself.

{{cs2|DK8|NiTRO|
[[Image:Clintonjobs.jpg|thumb|left|The infamous "[http://tinyurl.com/4rju9w Clinton Jobs]" page of [http://tinyurl.com/4qgen6 Nitro]]]
In response to all the [[MST]]ings of his work (nerd speak for making fun of people's [[fanfiction]]s Mystery Science Theater 3000 style), he made ''[http://tinyurl.com/4qgen6 NiTRO]'', where he hangs around in a space blimp (likely because he couldn't draw a spaceship to save his life) with a mannish bunny [[robot]] sex slave who gives him "[[blowjob|Clinton Jobs]]" (both literally and figuratively), but only after happily waiting on him hand and foot for weeks or months before he even notices her existence ([http://tinyurl.com/42gwjg No]. [http://tinyurl.com/3kuz2g Seriously]. This comic gives one a good idea of DaveyKins's opinion of women.) 

Of course, before all this he beats up [[MST|Pearl Forrester]] to express his rage at people making fun of his [[shit]] MST-style, breaks up with Sailor Moon, beats up an (apparently) female Sonic, and gets mauled by some random she-furry. All this beating of women makes one wonder what DaveyKins is trying to say here, or at least if he's implying he can only win in fisticuffs against the [[slut|fairer sex]]. It should be reiterated that [[retarded|he and his femme-bunnygirl-robot sidekick/dutchwife/sex slave travel through interstellar space in a blimp]].

The entire point of the comic seems to be DaveyKins just sucking his own [[cock]], licking his wounds, easing his [[butthurt]] etc. It features a whole lot of [http://tinyurl.com/4ctre3 other characters telling him how awesome he is and how jealous other people are of him]. In it DaveyKins has also drawn himself doing things he must have assumed looked cool. The comic ends with DaveyKins and his transvestite perfect-women-archetype bunny sex slave flying off in a space pod that looks suspiciously like a giant [[Pokemon|Pokeball]] to [http://tinyurl.com/493xx9 possibly assassinate the creators of Mystery Science Theater 3000].

{{cs2|DK9|Night Soldiers|
[[Image:Nightsoldiers1.jpg|thumb|"When you came out of the broom closet"]]When he was older and bitter, DaveyKins drew ''[http://tinyurl.com/4gcnp9 Night Soldiers]''. This comic was intended to seduce Sailor Moon fans away from the show, supposing to be a sort of [[lol|superior]] knock-off, we guess. However, it could not seduce anyone, especially with its ugly ass pictures of hairy-legged succubi. It features another author avatar Richard Kronos, high school football star turned cripple turned magical guy, he lives with his creepy uncle and wears [http://tinyurl.com/4hr4en a magical leg brace] of some kind covered in vague pagan symbols. Richard has a [[girlfriend]] who also stars in the comic, she's a [[Wicca]]n who dresses ''exactly'' like a Halloween witch and speaks in an old-timey [[Irish]] accent. The excuse for this is a bunch of kids sewed her a witch hat and she can hear voices through it so she doesn't mind dressing as an insult to herself. It still doesn't explain the Halloween costume robes. 

The main bad guy is [http://tinyurl.com/49dv2u the aforementioned hairy-legged succubi] who [[vore]]s people to death and steals their clothing, rather than [[fuck]]ing men in their sleep like she's supposed to. Thankfully, although the last page in existence reads "to be continued", Night Soldiers was never continued before it could reach its actual plot.

DaveyKins later attempted to adapt this comic to story format [http://foxfirestudios.net/ladyshazell.shtml entitled "Lady Shazell"] that he also submitted to a [http://witchwithin.homestead.com shitty Pagan web site.] This so-called "Wiccian Romantic Adventure Series" [sic] never got longer than four chapters.

{{cs2|DK10|Planeswalker|
[[Image:Planeswalker1.jpg|thumb|left|Quality you'd only expect from DaveyKins]]Sometime after ''Night Soldiers'' he drew ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20050209192055/www.furnation.com/FoxStudios/planes01/planes0001.html Planewalker]'', a Magic-the-Gathering based comic with a plot ripped from [[Yugioh]] and Card Captor Sakura. What makes this particular comic special is its in FULL GONTERIFIC TECHNICOLOR (read: he discovered the paint bucket tool.) The opening narration makes absolutely no sense but from what we can gather a portal opened one day for no reason and a particularly stupid sorceress from the magical realm on the other side came on through and closed the portal, trapping herself on Earth. Then she pointlessly trapped her own soul in a book. Then some thirteen year old girl named Jamie opened the book and gained her powers, some hideous magenta robes and eyes forever locked in a steely glare. 

Oh and the magic is based on cards, somehow, although no cards are ever pictured. Supposedly the makers of Magic the Gathering found one of numerous otherworldly books with a dumb wizard's soul inside and based the game on that. Those uncreative [[fuck]]s. It's one of the few Gontercomics that stars not only a female, but one that possibly ''isn't'' supposed to represent DaveyKins himself.

From there Jamie becomes schizophrenic and constantly argues with herself, wielding insanely, unnecessarily powerful magic against petty criminals. While this is going on some evil wizards observe her form afar and... don't do much else. Jamie develops a mommy complex about the sorceress woman infesting her brain and the sorceress woman [http://tinyurl.com/4h7wzb hangs around the house in Jamie's panties and training bra] in some sort of horrifying Gonterverse version of [[fanservice]]. 

Then some other people get a hold of ''another'' book with ''another'' wizard ghost inside it:

[[Image:Planeswalkergirlylink.gif|thumb|right|Link has breasts?]]
This comic was later revived by DaveyKins, which thanks to the WayBack Machine the [[lulz]] are now accessible. Somehow, the main character kidnaps [[Link]], turns him into an [[elf]] girl, and reveals herself to be some sort of dominatrix as she uses him/her as a [[sex]] slave. All this and more in horrible DaveyKins art styling. Ah, we're just kidding, what actually happens is the sorceress bitch kidnaps Jamie's best friend, ''turns her into'' an elf, ''dresses'' her like Link, and then molests her. ...Wow that's possibly even worse.

[[Image:DaveyKinsmaninprison.gif|thumb|left|Davey-kins appears!]]Horrifyingly enough he also [http://web.archive.org/web/20041207232455/foxfire.twu.net/planes/planes0066.html crosses it over] with [[Daveykins#Night_Soldiers|Night Soldiers]] <sub>(see above)</sub> and [[Daveykins#Bakabreakers|Bakabreakers]] <sub>(see below)</sub>.

For better or for worse, the Link-girl molestation scene seems to be the final page in existence. 

Part of DaveyKins's disclaimer/copyright information underneath each page of the comic gives one an idea of ''just'' how delusional he is:

This is the strange, rambling introduction in ''[http://tinyurl.com/4rofor Bakabreakers]'', a lesser known Gontercomic. This one stars a [[cosplay]]ing, robot fox/[[catgirl]] (who seems like bunny-sex-slave-from-NiTRO-2.0) and, in his continuing attempts to frantically scrub away the stain of accusations of racism, introduces the notion that DaveyKins has a Middle Eastern Muslim friend [http://tinyurl.com/4nnbk8 who makes lighthearted references to Jihad]. DaveyKins rants about his website going down and assures his [[lie|many fans]] there will be [[moar]] comics soon. Why he chose to write a comic to tell them about it during a site outage in which he couldn't upload any comics is anyone's guess.

The robot [[Mary Sue]] goes on to cry about being stereotyped as a robot [[Mary Sue]], and then we find out she's in love with one Adam Packbell who DaveyKins seems to [http://tinyurl.com/4kcuqt openly admit is a self-insert by making Adam's nickname "Daveykins Foxfire" also]. 

Beyond that, what the hell is actually ''going on'' in this comic is another question entirely. We can assure you there is nothing much "phracked up" or controversial in it, save maybe that stereotypical Muslim guy, but he's pretty chill for a [[terrorist]] [[Arab|towelhead]].

DaveyKins's latest project, displaying no improvement in his style and a further degeneration of his mind, is a true furry transformation fair and even better: [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/gallery/ it's updated regularly on devianTART! Oh boy!] This one is a sort of re-envisioning of his ancient [http://www.furnation.com/FoxStudios/archive/ComicStrip/strip01.html Foxfire comic.]

This one features Jim Goodlaw (again, David), who in Foxfire was an aspiring cartoonist from St. Louis who got his ass kissed by Stan Lee at a convention after someone else told him his comics were [[crap]] (lol wish fulfillment, [[amirite]]?) Now Jim's character appears to have been changed to that of a tough cop who is all pissed off that [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/Scarlet-PI-Strip-1-11019004 even though there's a WAR ON TERROR and he graduated top of his class] he can't get a job. DaveyKins, perhaps inspired by a recent watching of Queer Eye for The Straight Guy, decided that the best way to clean up his previous status as a big damn [[homophobe]] was to make the Jim Goodlaw of Scarlet P.I. [[homosexuality|TEH GAY]]. Even so, the plot continues much the same from there in both comics: Jim returns home, dejected, to find a package with a female fox [[fursuit]] in it waiting for him. Before he can fuck it silly, it starts talking, totally ruining the mood. The fursuit introduces itself as Susan Foxfire (to be inexplicably called "Scarlet" throughout the rest of the comic) and says she's a zoot, a symbiotic costume. 

Even though she can walk around fine and all, she apparently needs Davey-er Jim to wear her, otherwise she can't survive. And in the new version she needs his help to find out about this sinister lab she came from. Like a good [[sick fuck]], he does this, and they have crazy adventures, all with Jim loving his new furry tits. 
DaveyKins soon forgets that Jim was supposed to be [[gay]], or even be there at all, and the comic quickly becomes all about SCARLET, Jim obviously having just been a convenient plot device to get DaveyKins's [[sick fuck|hot vixen]] [[Mary Sue]] [[furry]] into the story.

The comic contains a lot of man on man-in-a-female-fursuit sex and something about the "zoots" being [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/Scarlet-PI-Strip-109-62073326 some scheme gone wrong] thought up by [[Disney]] theme parks (why Disney would need to make a female fox costume with giant [[tit]]s leaves one to wonder.) What any of this has to do with private investigation is beyond normal human reasoning. To give any more information on the plot would require reading the entire thing, many have tried, all have [[fail]]ed. The comic is stagnated with progressively worse [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/Scarlet-PI-Strip-110-63279665 (yes, possible)] entries as David dedicates more and more of his small span of attention to his 'writing', where he thinks [http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1063802/535093737 he'll be more successful] despite regularly writing stuff like 'twoard' and 'phrack'.

[[Image:DaveyKinsscarletbook.png|thumb|left|Nothing suspicious here!]] Scarlet is the star of Davey-kins' latest novel, ''Murder on Mainstreet USA'', which utilizes Disneyland as a setting. When speaking about the project, Davey-kins took a moment to show off his [[Unwarranted_self-importance|infamous ego]].

{{quote|<small><small>Nevertheless, I'd like to go on record and say that I'd like to work with Disney to get something productive out of this. Get a contract with some zeros into it, have a series made for their cable channels or something. That's what I'd like to see, and would want them to consider.</small></small>|[http://comments.deviantart.com/5/15538951/586661905 David Gonterman,]''The sound you hear is that of the jokes writing themselves.''|}}

DaveyKins is incapable of ever finishing a single comic and always ends up starting something else that still crosses-over with every other goddamn thing he's ever done and so, true to form, he's now threatened to launch a magical girl spin-off series entitled "[http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/Magical-Girl-Melody-Teaser-74594013 Stealth Princess Melody]". And since DaveyKins can't write anything that isn't based off some pre-existing film, book, card game or [[animu]] the main character's costume design is a combination of outfits worn in ''[[Sailor Moon]]'','' Saint Tail'', and ''Princess Tutu''. To top it all off, she carries a gun that's been ripped straight out of the winniest [[video game|videah game]] of all time: ''[[Portal]]''. For this he deserves to be flamed into ''dust''.

[[Image:DaveyKinsblacksenshi.png|thumb|right|DaveyKins's claim to having further defiled Sailor Moon.  Let's be thankful this never saw the light of day.]]In February 2008, DaveyKins announced his plans to [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/SPI-Remix-Teaser-78468396 publish the comic].

Although Davey-Kins's horrible-ass fanfictions and comics had been known to the MiSTing communities since 1998, he did not receive proper exposure until his faggotry was discovered by the [[Portal of Evil]] in [[2000]]. Many [[lulz]] were made at his expense and a comic featuring the POE residents taking on DaveyKins and the related thread eventually reached [[IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!|over 9,000]] comments ([http://www.portalofevil.com/single.php?poeurlid=000002101 no, srsly]). This was the exact moment DaveyKins became an [[Internet celebrity]].

I think I feel pretty much the lowest I’ve ever felt this morning. Just as I was about to get going on my second book when I got the word. [[anonymous|Someone]] has [[pwnt|hacked into]] my Wiki site and royally [[pain series|smucked it up]]. I’ll spare you the horrid details, but I’ll just say that it’s [[nsfw|not safe for work]], not safe for [[furries|Disney]], and not safe for [[muddy dicks|human consumption]]. Let’s just say that it made the joke [[The Aristocrats|“The Aristrocrates”]] tame in comparison.
<br><br>
And then I looked at the date of the changes: July 20.
<br><br>
I’ll say it again. July 20.
<br><br>
[[lol|I just received word of the vandalism TODAY!]]
<br><br>
I don’t know whom I should be angry over worse: The [[troll|Radio Edit]] who put this up, or  
[[faggot|ME]]! FOR LETTING IT STAY ON THIS LONG!!!!
<br><br>
...I really need [[hugbox|some support]] right now, because I’ve [[Delete fucking everything|deleted

===''So Not the Draema''===
[[Image:IMMARITINMAHBOOKZ.gif|20px|thumb|right]]
Still butthurt over the bannination of the [[The Anti-ED-Club|Anti-ED-Club]], DaveyKins [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/journal/14383232/ takes it into his own hands] to [[cry|bring light]] to ED's so called "[[Lulz|luls]]" in his new book "[[unfunny|''So Not the Draema'']]." No, [[O rly|really]]. In usual DaveyKins fashion, he couldn't be bothered to come up with a title not <strike>based on</strike> ripping something off (in this case, "Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama"). Note that in the subsequent comments on his shocking news, everyone tries to bash him with repeated reality, only to find steadfast denial on DaveyKins's part, creating more Lulz as they abandon him as the sinking ship he is. 

[[Image:DaveykinsFoxFire DAJ 144181.gif|20px|thumb|left]]
In the aftermath of his latest anti-ED plans, many people tried to make David understand that in writing his book, he'd only be a target for more lulz, so, faced with so much rejection and denial, he set out to [[Delete Fucking Everything]] and cover his tracks, only creating more lulz [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/journal/14418160/#comments with his justifications to do so], and even losing people who mysteriously supported him before. (Like drawing  an actually [http://bunnyfriend.deviantart.com/art/Lost-Boy-Found-54438991 decent cover for his book], only to have it covered with [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/art/Lost-Boy-Found-Official-Cover-59250653 David's terrible 'art'])
[[Image:DaveykinsLittlecloud.jpg|80px|thumb|right|[[Lolcow|Avengers]] assemble!]]

It should also be noted that Daveykins is attracting the attention of his fellow [[butthurt]] ED "victims."

===ED killed Megan Meier!===
At least that's what this loon says, [http://foxfirestudios.net/wordpress/?p=18 in his most recent blog entry], where he goes on and on again on his bullshit about how writing his book about ED will magically stop all the [[troll]]in' and make everyone feel better, making him [[an Hero]]. It is worthy mentioning that he calls himself '[[Unwarranted_self-importance|one of the top ten most flamed people on the internet]]', right there with [[Chris Crocker]] AND [[George W. Bush]], despite no one bothering to email him anymore since his brief stint of internet fame (he also implies in this statement that anyone besides himself actually refers to DaveyKins as "Daveykins Foxfire").

As expected, DaveyKins's reading comprehension is poor and he doesn't realize [[Megan Meier]] was never on ED before she hung herself over [[MySpace]], and ED exists to document internet drama, and if that's not internet drama, [[Anonymous]] doesn't know what is. Megan was done in by the mother of her ex-[[BFF]] pretending to be a teenage boy, all ED did was report the [[lulz]].

===January 8: DaveyKins Day===
On January 8th, 2008, a brave (and possibly masochistic) Anonymous on [[4chan]]'s /co/ board decided to embark upon posting the entire series of DaveyKins's FoxFire comics. This level of epic horror had not been felt by /co/ before, and it was decided that the sacrifice of the selfless Anonymous that posted the comics must never be forgotten. As such, January 8th was officially declared to be DaveyKins Day (G-Day), so that the world will not forget the horrors that were unleashed by the Internet's Most Dangerous Cartoonist. Suggested celebrations for DaveyKins Day include MST'ing his works and posting comments on his deviantArt account.

On the first G-Day, it was made known that DaveyKins actually has an Xbox Live account, and has been confirmed to exist by brave Xbots. Demonstrating a considerable lack of imagination, the username David Gonterman is apparently not fondly looked upon by Halofags. According to some accounts, he and his teammates tend to be "weapon-camping fucktards", which is not terribly surprising. Some of the fucktards with which he associates usernames include ErroneousLumen and XxXKarmacideXxX, but it's better to refer to their formal names, which are Fucktard 1 and Fucktard 2.

===My Rep's a Lemon and I Want My Money Back===
On September 14th, 2008, DaveyKins posted [http://daveykinsfoxfire.deviantart.com/journal/20490226/ a new journal on his deviantArt account] wherein he claims that he's looking into hiring a company that promises to [[bullshit|improve one's Internet reputation]] so that he can reclaim his "good name."  He also proceeds to whine about ED, claim that they (among others) are the reason he can't leave his past works behind, and proceeds to apologize for all the shit he's unleashed upon the world:

<blockquote>
I’m sorry for writing ‘Piasa’ the way I did. I want to rewrite it and make it what it should have been (a domestic take on a Toho-style Godzilla movie) all along. I’m sorry for ‘Sailor Moon: American Kitsune.’ I’m sorry for making the original version of ‘BAM’ the quagmire it became. I’m sorry for all those half-assed works, both in word and in art, that most people troll me over. I’m sorry for getting so bogged down in the flack that I end up dropping projects and looking for a better replacement in areas that might not welcome me in. And I’m especially sorry for being an ass about it all. I wish I’ve never done any of it. I wish I could leave it behind–it is over a decade old, I need to say–and move on with my life.
</blockquote>

And then, he lets loose with one of the lulziest lines he's ever put out on the web:

<blockquote>
I want to be known for what I can do, instead of someone else’s lulz.
</blockquote>
