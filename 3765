[http://www.hotornot.com/ HotorNot.com] is yet another [[Web 1.0| cheaply operated]] site that uses pictures volunteered by the [[Your Mom|e-public]] to lure [[you|other desperates]] into a Jew [[Scam| dating service]]. Describing itself as "[[USI|the original]] online service where you can rate photos, find [[camwhore|singles]] for [[Sex|dating]], and meet [[whore|women]] or [[fag|men]]". The site features pics of people's faces and forbids [[Nude|nudity]] and as such, [[Fail|nobody cares to visit it]] since the similairly poor quality pictures of skanks at [[Youtube]] are of the moving variety. It is only even remotely useful for [[face-painter]]s, and even in ''that'' case, there are many, many [http://amish-online-dating.com better alternatives]. HotorNot.com is a useful resource if you'd like to experience all the usual camwhore [[crap|gimmicks]]; [[fat girl angle shot]]s, [[whore]]ishness, [[unwarranted self-importance]], [[12 year old girls| puckered mouth syndrome]], [[guido]]s and self-proclaimed [[My Tiny Dick|studs]]. These [[The Law of Conformity|approval craving souls]] check their profile rating regularly. Their [[self-esteem]] is directly proportional to their rating. You can [[troll]] them by letting them know [[Vomit|how you really feel]] when you select a rating.

Although [[some argue]] that there is a formula relating to [[facial]] symmetry that can be used to objectively determine [[Hott|attractiveness]], the ratings at HotorNot.com usually approach X over time, as derived from a different formula, [[:User:Prace|Prace's]] [[College|Theorem]]:

<center>'''''X = (S-O)*(R - A/10) + B'''''</center>

Where "S" is the percentage of Skin shown, "O" is the apparent percentage [[Fat|Overweight]], "R" is a Racial variable giving 10 for [[White People|white]]s, 8 for [[Azn|asian]]s, 6 for Mexicans and [[gypsies]], 4 for [[jews]] and 2 for [[nigra]]s and A is the apparent [[Age]] of the person in question. B is an all or nothing three point variable for those with large [[Breasts]], [[No girls on the internet| if they are apparently female]]. Upon analysing the math we discover facial features, tan lines, tattoos, beauty marks and all that other rubbish don't mean a damn thing in the long run. The average voter is most interested in [[n00ds|nude]], [[Ana|thin,]] white, [[Pedophilia|young]] tits. [[Yaoi|But that's not surprising, because who isn't?]]
