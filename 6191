There weren't very many protesters but it was still a win. We protested in front of the org, and then at the intersection down the street from the org. Then a few of us handed out fliers at the river fest.

Pretty good turnout thanks to the decent weather.
Our main group centered in Millennium park's central west entrance and spread throughout the park concentrating on points of entry/exit and popular tourist areas. 
Another group took a megaphone across the street from the park for music and dancing.
Later, the megaphone group took a walk around the loop stopping outside NBC and ABC studios and rocking massive air guitar to Dragonforce.

Around 3:45pm the police -who were being very cool with us- asked if we could move our protest out of the park.
We obliged and began a longcat walk up Michigan Avenue, Bel Airing tourists and the public in general, both of which met us with curious -but mostly positive- looks and smiles.

Hundreds of flyers were handed out during the march.

Also, we Rickrolled an entire architectural tour boat. They loved it.

It was warm out but not a large turnout, about 30 people showed up (possibly due to it being prom/graduation season).
Lots of flyers were handed out and the public seemed generally interested. Drunk pedestrians provided multiple lulz.

despite the rain, we did a great job. I personally brought over 500 flyers and went home with maybe 60. we had several
roaming bands of Anons and we had an Excellent flag. our boombox crapped out, so we sang and chanted instead. A small 
amount of trouble with one of the businesses (they obviously don't like us) but no big problems.
We had a GREAT speech and a great time.
