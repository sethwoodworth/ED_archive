'''Zero Punctuation''' is a weekly feature on a [[shit]] website called [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/ ''Escapist Magazine''], where [[Video Game Critic|videogame reviewer]] and fan-proclaimed [[pro]]fessional [[troll]] Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw doing a poor man's Charlie Brooker impression as he tears into the parade of [[Sonic the Hedgehog|shitty games]] currently comprising today's market for the amusement of the masses and the enragement of [[fanboy]]s around [[Za Warudo|the world]].  Actually, it's more like a [[drunk]] discussion with a friend about that new [[Video games|game]] he just got, rather than the format most review sites use; focus on the same positives every time, and give a score based on a scale between 9 and 10, or the reviewer gets [[Jeff_Gerstmann|fired]]. He does sometimes give games, like [[Portal]], the praise and [[Less than three|love]] they [[Lie|rightfully deserve]]. Though much more often, he's forced to review a [[Brawl|shitty game]], and then the segment is more comparable to what the [[Japanese]] did to [[China|Nanking]] during [[WWII]]. He is also a [[goon]]. Croshaw has gained quite a fanbase, although that is only due to the overwhelming number of stupid libs who think that a guy who talks fast and makes half-baked murka-bashing metaphors is an automatic genius and comedic mastermind.

==Backstory==

{{quote|...Also, I think Hitler was right!|Typical quote from '''Yahtzee'''}}

[[Image:Yahtzee C 64.jpg|thumb|left|Yahtzee's system of choice is the [[old|Commodore 64]].]]
According to the escapist website, Yahtzee was born on a [[United Kingdom|small, unimportant, tea-obsessed island]] off the coast of [[Europe]], but currently lives on a [[Australia|slightly larger, unimportant, Vegemite-obsessed island]] with a bunch of kangaroos and [[Steve Irwin|stingrays]]. Eventually, living in such a nationalistic site made him a critic and inevitably one of the most stuck-up people who would even criticize a hooker if her pussy wasn't to his every little standard. 

Yahtzee got his start at professional [[troll|reviewing]] after watching a few series of Charlie Brooker's '''Screenwipe''' and [[Tracing|ripping-off]] his review format by posting his abusive, [[Speedycat|fast-paced]], rambling reviews to [[YouTube]], just like hundreds of other [[nerd]]s on the [[Internets]].  However, unlike the other [[loser]]s, Yahtzee's reviews were actually [[lame | funny]].  The first games that Yahtzee reviewed in his trademark video format were the [[PS3]] demo of ''The Darkness'' and the [[PC]] version of ''Fable''.  After tearing each of the games several new [[asshole]]s, Yahtzee became noticed by others on the tubes.  Soon after, some [[troll]] from The Escapist signed him on to his website so that Yahtzee could continue verbally [[rape|raping]] games full-time.

As a [[free]]ware game designer, Yahtzee maintains an overly critical, slightly [[pretentious]] approach to reviewing, yet still includes enough harsh insults and [[cock|dick]]/[[boob]]/[[gay]] jokes to satisfy the [[you|average internet goer]].  Yahtzee has a personal website called fullyramblomatic.com, where he posts review updates, downloads for his own games (mostly text/story based adventure games), random essays/rants, and other amusing articles on various nerdy topics. Among his nerdy topics include a rant about how proud he is to be a [[England|snob]], he has expressed his dislike for the [[America|"Important" apple-pie obsessed landmass]] and has denied stereotypes about his people while saying every stereotype about those he hates are 100% true.

His site contains everything one would expect from a lifelong computer dork.

==Advancements in the Field of Trolling==
[[Image:Yahtzee Handjob.gif|thumb|left|Yahtzee is known to let people [[Bukkake|jack off in his face]].]]
[[Image:Yahtzee Valve.jpg|thumb|right|The man himself (he's in the hat, obviously).]]
Yahtzee is particularly famous for giving spectacularly [[hate]]ful reviews to various popular games, thus earning him both tremendous amounts of praise and scorn.  Some of his notable achievements in stirring up [[drama]] include calling [[Halo]] 3 mediocre and forcing it to live up to its [[shit|single-player campaign]], playing only a few hours of ''[[The Witcher]]'' before getting [[bored]] and verbally trashing it, and generally throwing heaping amounts of criticism on any game that crosses his path.

However, his most [[epic win]] came when he reviewed ''[[Super Smash Bros.]] Brawl'' in April '08.  Naturally, he hated it and gave a hilariously negative review; and seeing as SSBB was probably the most hyped game this side of ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]'', [[Nintendo]] [[fanboys]] were sent into psychotic rages, unable to accept the [[fact]] that anyone could speak badly of their beloved title.  The [[butthurt]] Brawl fans quickly filled the comment section of the video with [[over 9000|over 1,000]] comments, roughly 5 times the average amount of comments for a ZP review.

So, two weeks later, Yahtzee responded to his fans.  Being the [[House|misanthropic asshole]] that he is, Yahtzee chose to [[pwned|publicly humiliate]] some of the [[dipshit]]s that sent him [[hate mail]].  Again, the [[retard]]ed masses went into an uproar, some cursing Yahtzee, but most congratulating him on his successful [[troll]]ing and deconstruction of Smash Bros Brawl and its [[Homosexuality|fans]].

===MGS4===
Also caused a shitload of nerd rage, nearly on the same level as the ''Brawl'' review. He was the only person on the entire Earth to realize how confusing the narrative is [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/99-Metal-Gear-Solid-4 Link].

===Call of Duty 4===
Thought of as another episode of him trolling the viewers because he gave it a positive review for being a [[bullshit|fresh]] and [[lie|innovative]] take on the First Person Shooter Genre, but that's impossible because the game is mediocre, overrated and filled with [[13 year old boys]]. In the end, it turns out he was serious. He did state that he never played the multiplayer of a game, so that might not have raped the experience like it did to the rest of [[retards|us]] and gives us a [[zero|wide picture of his social life]].

===Webcomics===
Then, one week later, he went on to turn the condescension and rage towards the gaming [[webcomic]] community, known more commonly as the internet's nerdy, unwanted, failed abortion. The main point of the review wasn't so much to review anything as it was to point out to all the world his eerie obsession with [[Tim Buckley]] and his shit comic, ''[[CTRL+ALT+Delete]]'', which by the way sucks dog shit. Not that this is going to affect CAD's ratings at all, as pretty much everyone else on the internet has been proclaiming this shit to [[Noone|anyone who would listen]] for ages. Anyway, after the webcomics review, he is now loved by all once again and all is right with the world. [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/108-Webcomics The review in question].

So what is our [[faggot|egotistic maniac]], [[Tim Buckley]] saying about this? Nothing for now. He has however, been [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel&action=history watching his Wikipedia article like a hawk] (see user Thrindel), and will be more than willing to flash Wikipedia's rule book in your face if you edit it. No doubt that Tim is very [[butthurt]] about this, and a lulz-filled reply is due sooner or later.

*NO U:  Comic Genesis has an archive of Yahtzee's very own comic "[http://yahtzee.comicgenesis.com/ Yahtzee Takes On the World]." 642 updates at last count. Turns out it's almost as wordy and [[unfunny]] as CAD itself, making his review nothing more than a jealous rant (He even apologizes for offending people [http://yahtzee.comicgenesis.com/d/20010920.html/ in this strip])... not that it makes it less true or anything, though, because ''CTRL+ALT+Delete'' is still gayer than a bag of dicks.  Yahtzee would later admit that his web comics were [[shit]].  He also mentioned that most of his games were shit.  So at least he repents his sins.

===inFAMOUS VS. Prototype===
[[Image:Mcgrath.jpg|thumb|right|infamous' Cher lookalike]]
[[Image:Mercer.jpg|thumb|left|This one is Alex Mercer. Notice his look of ecstacy]]
[[Last thursday]] Yahtzee did a review of the supervillain sandbox game Prototype, which came out about a day after another supervillain sandbox game, inFAMOUS. In the review he compared the two games, and he concluded that they are both equally as good as each other. But fuck equality right? Well, Yahtzee came to the same conclusion, and decided that the winner between the two would be whichever design team could send him the best picture of the other game's main character in a bra. Little did he know that [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/op-ed/6228-Yahtzees-Prototype-vs-InFamous-Challenge both teams would accept the challenge, let alone care.] Well it turns that they did. <s>Radical put their best team of photoshoppers to work and returned with the image to the right. Sucker Punch, however, kicked things up a notch with a fucking painting, which can be seen to the left.</s> Other way around, you shit dick editor. In the end, victory was decided by which hero put the best set of [[tits|knockers]] on display, and inFAMOUS pulled ahead to win the gold. The real winner, however, is Yahtzee, who, as a result of this troll, won a grand total of eleven (11) internets. In addition, The Escapist won one (1) honorary internet for featuring the article on their front page. It's still a shitty site though.{{clear}}

==GameDamage==
[[Image:Crowshaw&TheWallabyFuckers.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Yahtzee babysits a couple of Wallaby-Fuckers on his new show.]]

[[Last Thursday]], Yahtzee decided that the [[internets]] were simply too small a media to contain his [[Shit|nonexistent]] talents and so Mr. Crowshaw's next venture is a car crash of a TV pilot by the name of [http://www.gamedamage.net GameDamage].  

A show that is just as bad as if it consisted of the Taliban flying [[Princess Diana]]'s funeral procession escorted by a bus full of blind orphans into the World Trade Center on 9/11. Alternatively, imagine having an tramp with a set of pliers and a piece of cardboard attempt to remove a golf bag, with rackets, from your rectum by way of eyes and ears while demanding that you suck his smelly hasn't-been-washed-since-he-lost-his-job-in-1962 penis by way of payment. You then, may just, be arriving in the general vicinity of the suburbs of the forest of failure and incongruous horror that is, GameDamage.

Needless to say, in his recent podcast with [[ScrewAttack]], Yahtzee said the show is dead in the water, after no company in the civilized world wanted to go anywhere near it.

== Fursupporter? ==
[[Image:Cidandyahtzee.JPG|thumb|right|Proof.]]
You would think than any [[HA HA HA, OH WOW|self-respecting goon]] would be careful to come near furries, let alone befriend one. However, as the picture show, Yahtzee have added infamous furfag and [[sick fuck]] (excuse the redundancy) [[Cid Silverwing]] as a friend on his Escapist profile. Of course, [[Some argue|chances are]] that Yahtzee knows nothing about Cid Silverwing or his online escapades and have befriend him out of pure duty without a second thought. Not that it in any way excuses handing Cid more fuel for his [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|ego]].

Further evidence of his lack of fur-liking comes from his latest written article of [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/7141-Extra-Punctuation-Space-Flying-and-Space-Flying.2| Extra Punctuation], where he responds to a message from one of his watchers, asking him if he believes if Too Human was worse than Sonic Unleashed. He responded as follows:

{{quote|What, are you stupid? Of course it is. At least Sonic Unleashed doesn't... oh. Ohhh. I see your plan. You're trying to make me say something nice about Sonic Unleashed so you can quote it out of context on forums full of oblivious furry-loving dickbiscuits still manfully trying to convince themselves that Sonic is worth a damn. | '''Yahtzee''' on proving his innocence}}
