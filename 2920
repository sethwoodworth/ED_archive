'''"[http://www.ferrariguyforhire.com Ferrari Guy]"''' (aka [[Power Word|Tony Tag]], aka [[hard gay|Sammi Hagar]], Tony [[Fag]], aka [[Bikerfox]] 2.0) is a [[Guido|greasy]] 50 year old [[wannabe]] [[internet celebrity|internet]]/[[IRL]] [[celebrity]] from [[Chicago]] who has reinvented the term [[douchebag]]. Described as a mix of a retired [[porn star]] and a washed up [[Contra|80's hair band reject]], this [[srsly|asshole]] has recently been promoting his fail all over the internet whilst trying to [[pimp]] his shitty "[[theft|services]]" online, charging [[Adam Goldstein|$300/hr]] to [[you|morons]] stupid enough to pay his [[old|over-the-hill]] ass for a ride to [[7-11]].  

It seems that Ferrari Guy recently closed [http://www.ferrariguyforhire.com his website] (back now) in record time only a week after his faggotry and [[Orangeskin|spray tanned]] mug were discovered, making the usual rounds on every [[forum]] and [[blog]] on the interbutts in mid June.  A [http://www.ferrariguy.com/ new hub for his faggotry] may be up and running soon so dozens more can ask exactly [[suck cock|how]] this dumbass owns a Ferrari in the first place.

==The Douche Himself==

Ferrari Guy likes to think of himself as a [[cancer|fixture]] of the [[Chicago]]-land area and the hottest new thing on the [[internets]].  He's a guy who's all about getting himself out there and he'd love you to drop at least a week's salary at your shitty [[job]] so you can look like a complete [[faggot]] sitting next to some [[hipster]] [[wop]] with a [[mullet]]. As you probably guessed, this guy isn't the wonderful human being he makes himself out to be, he's actually one serious faggot [[IRL]].

[[Some argue]] that he goes right into full-on greaseball mode the moment he wakes up, while [[You|others]] believe that it takes him a few hours to build up to it. Since no one will ever wake up next to this loser, we will never know for sure.

==Tony Getting [[YHBT|Trolled]]==

==Ferrari Guy's [[TOW]] Article==

Much to Tony's [[butthurt|dismay]] it turns out he isn't quite [[internet famous]] yet, so they dumped his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tag_(deleted_20_Apr_2008_at_17:46) shitty TOW stub], which seemed to consist of exactly one half [[SSP|cock slurping]] and one half [[lulz]].

Tony fancies himself the [[alpha male]] you could only dream to be and awaits the day when Chicagoans greet him with open arms to hoist him on their shoulders. Unfortunately, most [[NORPS|citizens]] of the windy city seem to have [[gtfo|a different opinion]] of him:

===FG's Adoring Public===

|I see this guy all the time. I ride my bicycle to work a lot during the summer and the [[douche]] is always parked out at the lakefront with his shirt off sitting on the hood of his Ferrari. I have long gotten a [[gaydar|major prick vibe]] just seeing him, this confirms it. If you want to witness in person go to the North Ave Beach parking lot (by the fake ship beach house) on a sunny day. He WILL be there.|dopplerd (sounds like a [[murder|plan]])
|I've seen this guy on [[Faggotry|Michigan Avenue]] for years, and he always [[yes|looks like an idiot]]. He's usually shirtless! I wouldn't be caught [[assrape|dead in his car]]. All the [[retards|locals]] are quite [[gtfo|familiar]] with his obnoxious [[pedobear|prowling]] downtown and you'd look like an idiot next to him.|b612markt
|This is the way to [[kill]] the competition. Have this [[rly|douche]] drive their cars.|brickyard
|I live in Chicago and literally see this guy down in the beach parking lot [[glory hole|every time I go down there]]. I believe his name is [[Guido|Tony Tag]]. [[Thursday|Last Sunday]] I saw him digging through the trunk of his [[dogshit|El Dorado]]. It's a piece of sh*t. Very Jew, very [[Communism|red]]. My [[handjob|buddy]] and I were talking before our arrival wondering if we'd see Tony down there, and sure enough, he was! [[not gay|Shirtless]] as usual. We always thought his Ferrari was a kit car.|Patrick B.Knudsen
|I'm [[99.9%|not 100%]] positive but last year in May I was at a [[Shotacon|convention]] in the city and afterwards I went for a walk down Michigan Avenue and I saw someone who was driving either a red [[SNCA|F430/F360]] and he had long curly platinum blond hair. He was cruising the downtown area and kept making passes and attempting to show off his car. I only remember the incident because he had personalized license plates which read "[[twat|Tony T]]". The plates on his homepage are different but it may have very well been the same guy.|Some other fag who saw him

==Trivia==
*His website says he will drive you around on your wedding, but [[Retard|the car has just two fucking seats]].
*Check under "Services" on his site. Wonder what the [[Rape|"Special Gift"]] is?
*Limo for one? But still [[Fail|300 fucking dollars?]] You get to ride with him for 5 minutes and pay a huge fucking price.
*Gets extremely butthurt if you question [[FAGGOT|his sexuality]].
