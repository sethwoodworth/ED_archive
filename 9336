José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero is the president of [[Spain|Mexico]]. Since [[nobody cares]] what little Spanish-speaking people do as long as the lawn looks good, nothing is known about his life or politics except that his physical resemblance to Rowan "Mister Bean" Atkinson and hideous grin have made him the subject of numerous shoops.

==Zapatero's Secret SHAME==

In September of 2009, in between ignoring the tearful MySpace friend requests which were arriving from [[Gordon Brown]] on a half-hourly basis, [[Obama]] met with Zapatero and his family. His press office, wanting to make the best of a golden photo-opportunity, quickly uploaded it to Flickr. What they didn't know was that nobody in the world - Spain included - had seen Zappa's daughters before, because under Spanish law minors can be protected from having their photographs circulated for their own protection.

The world's jaw hung slack in shock. The domestic horror that Zapatero had used Spanish privacy legislation to cover up left [[Josef Fritzl]] looking tame. Zapatero... had spawned FAT GOTH CHICKS.
