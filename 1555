What do you get when you mix a [[pedophile]], a [[faggots|faggot]], an [[lawyer|e-lawyer]], and a [[perez hilton|journalist]]? You get '''Chris Stone''', aka Sticky, owner and [[moderator]] of Stickydrama: A [[tabloid]] about [[internet celebrities|people nobody cares about]]. 

__TOC__

==Backstory==
[[File:Chris_Stone.jpg|thumb|300px|left| [[Linkin Park]] wants their hairstyle back]]

Chris, [[lie|now 30 for the fifth time]], started out as a [[porn]] videographer. His career wasn't quite lucrative enough, as regular porn is free on the [[internet]], and his [[ugly|misshapen face]] and [[fat|dumpy body]] weren't helping him get the [[straight]] man ass he so desperately desired. 

Lurking the internet, fugly and alone, he struck gold in [[2005]] when [[stickam]] was invented. One live show and he knew, now was his chance to exploit the [[attention whores]] and [[internet celebrities]] he so desperately wished to be.

Thus Stickydrama and Stickyn00dz were invented! Websites which documented the shame and [[n00dz|naked pictures]] of stickam users, no matter how [[teenager|young]] and [[illegal]] they were.

==Chris Stone Vs. Livejournal==



[[File:Shaming.PNG|thumb|150px|Chris Stone actively participates in victim-shaming, so long as he isn't the victim]]

In early [[2009]], [[John Hock]], an [[internet celebrity]] and registered sex offender, was caught [http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10263161-71.html raping his girlfriend while she was passed out, all while being captured on his webcam.] The news was posted to both Stickydrama and a rival livejournal community called [http://efagz.livejournal.com efagz]. 

[[File:Allbrightletter.png|thumb|150px|left|I guess you can have the evidence of a [[rape]]. Thanks a lot for asking, assholes!]]


Members of efagz responded by reporting the crime to the police, while Chris posted screen captures of the video, allowed stories that called the victim a [[slut]], and revealed her identity. He was more concerned about getting traffic to his website than reporting the crime.

Three months later, after collecting witness testimonies and learning about what Stickydrama actually was, Police officers issued a search warrant for the host of the website, hoping to find the video which Chris had mentioned having. They would have e-mailed him, but at time time he was hiding his true identity, and there was no contact info listed on his website. Once he learned about the warrant, he finally got off his fat ass and sent police the video.

{{quote|StickyDrama awoke this morning to read a shocking support ticket from our web host: The Phoenix, Arizona Police Department had served the host a search warrant. We could not help but feel the handling of the warrant was … well … rude! We would have happily handed over our recording to the police, had they only asked us. But instead of sending a courteous email, the police took our server offline without warning. StickyDrama did our civic duty today, and mailed Detective Allbright a CD containing the Quicktime recording|Chris Stone [http://www.stickydrama.com/2009/05/phoenix-police-execute-warrant-on-stickydrama bawwing about having to do actual work]}}

[[File:Chris_stone_exagerrating.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[bullshit|He totally sent that video in out of the kindness of his heart]]]]
[[File:Chris_stone_court_date.jpg|thumb|150px|The court date was August 12th]]
[[File:Courtcase.jpg|thumb|150px|WAS being the keyword]]

John Hock was arrested, everyone celebrated, and life went on. That is, until efagz members caught Chris [[lie|exaggerating]] his involvement in the case, and gloating about putting Hock in jail. Members couldn't help but out him, and the infamous [http://stickyjustice.blogspot.com/?zx=4c3c66698dfd25b2 deleted post] was born.

Of all the people who have filed [[internet lawsuit|internet lolsuits]], very few have actually [http://community.livejournal.com/efagz/570350.html paid money to sue the internet]. Chris Stone is the exception to the rule. He is so [[butthurt]] about people who [[troll|don't like]] him, that he is taking [[livejournal]] to court this August. Instead of being a [[normal]] human being, and simply asking the moderators, or even the user who created the entry to take it down, he filed a [[lawsuit|lolsuit]] against the community's host. He cried libel, a phrase he often taunted Kiki Kannibal for using, and everyone laughed in his face.

Livejournal just deleted the post and moved on, content not to bother with this [[drama]] that they didn't care about. But the members found the post too [[lulz|lulzy]] to be deleted, and [http://stickyjustice.blogspot.com/?zx=4c3c66698dfd25b2 reposted it] on [[blogspot]]. This caused massive amounts of [[rage|RAAAAAAGE]] on Chris's part, but he tried to play it cool.

[[File:Chris_Stone_Libel.gif|thumb|300px|left|Chris Stone sues the internet for libel]]

{{quote|Ah, but that post will get almost no views. And if it does build up traffic, I can simply C&D Google, which is also in California.|Chris [http://twitter.com/stickydrama/status/16994180724 pretending he has legal ground to remove the entry]}}

The post got over 1,000 views in the first week, and continues to get traffic. [[x y is x|Empty threats were empty]], as they usually are with Sticky. Soon, more serious news sources would catch wind of the situation, and [[consequences will never be the same|consequences would never be the same]].

All the while, in an attempted to [[troll|keep track of]] the community, presumably to only increase the chances of winning his [[libel]] case against the internet. Posing as a 14 year old girl, Chris was met with cries of [[lindsay lohan|SHE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE]] and was almost immediately caught.

==Chris and Sextortion==
[[File:Sticky2.gif|thumb|150px|left|I R [[serious|SRS]] Webmaster]]

People began ignoring him again, and more viewers were abandoning his [[boring]] website for [http://efagz.livejournal.com more lulzy sites]. Unable to function without attention, the [[lolcow]] needed to be milked. Posing as a [[white knight|good person with good intentions]], he contacted [[fox news|faux news]] in an attempt to expose rival ''sextortionists'' who were cutting into his business. 

<video type="youtube" id="rkgby5c0Fp8" width="480" height="360" frame="false" position="center"/>

Since they can never pass up the opportunity to report [[bullshit]], Faux News ran with the story, allowing Chris, one of the internet's leading sextortionists, to out people like him, all while pretending to be innocent. Again, efagz were on the case, leaving comments on the news report about their source. In an attempt to hide their [[fail]], the webmaster [[baleeted]] all comments and disabled any future comments on the subject.

[[File:Chris_stone_semantics.png|thumb|150px|[[baw|bawing]] over semantics]]
[[File:Chrisstonememe09.jpg|thumb|150px|One typo = so much libel]]

Another [[flame war]] of epic proportions raged on, until [[gawker]] [http://gawker.com/5595591/stickydramas-christopher-stone-is-a-sextortion-expert-in-more-ways-than-one caught wind of the situation], thanks to a not-so-[[anonymous]] tip. [[Adrian Chen]] wrote three different articles bashing Chris and his websites, including one about [http://gawker.com/5594227/stickydramas-owner-watched-a-live+streamed-rape-recorded-and-blogged-about-itbut-didnt-report-it?skyline=true&s=i witholding the evidence of rape]. Sticky now has two wars on his hands, Gawker AND Efagz. Shouts of libel were heard round the world!

{{quote|@AdrianChen You publish so much libel, it's hard to keep up. @stawkkalyssa fed you demonstrably false info. |Chris Stone [http://twitter.com/stickydrama/status/19455247627 using his favorite phrase]}}

Adrian wasn't an [[idiot]], nor was he scared like most of Chris's victims. He simply crossed out the typo and corrected the error. Chris had no way to argue back, and used Adrian's location as a cop out. He also threatened the girl who he tried to sextort in the first place.

{{quote|Suing Gawker for libel would be prohibitively expensive since they're in NYC. Adding @stawkkalyssa to my existing CA lawsuit is free. |Chris Stone [http://twitter.com/mrpoe/status/19456197947 pretending he knows the law]}}

Good idea is good, get this image brought into court:

==Delusions of Grandure==

[[File:Sticky_threats_04.JPG|thumb|150px| [[Internet tough guy]] 101]]

[[File:Sticky_threats_01.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Sticky thinks livejournal keeps track of home addresses and telephone numbers]]

[[File:Sticky_deleted_tweets_july_29.JPG|thumb|150px|left| [[In b4]] [[4chan]] is not your [[personal army]] ]]

[[File:Sticky_threats_05.JPG|thumb|150px|Legal]]

[[File:Sticky_threats_03.JPG|thumb|150px|Illegal]]

Sticky is about as [[retarded|delusional]] as someone can get. He is a textbook [[internet tough guy]], who thinks that his ''minions'' will do his bidding. However, his [[fail|failure]] may be linked to the fact that his minions are [[scene]] [[whores]], [[groupies]], and 14 year old [[emofags]].

{{quote|Knowing that I asked for nothing. I demanded. And was obeyed|Chris displaying his overwhelming sense of [[unwarranted self importance]]}}

He frequently posts the addresses and phone numbers of those mere mortals who dare cross him in hopes that his twitter followers will [[troll]] them [[IRL]]. He's even convinced that [[4chan]] will back him.

Chris somehow managed to skirt the law, and twitter's t.o.s., every time. According to Chris, it's perfectly legal to post the private information of people, even when it's not public record, because [[oldfag|this one time]] people used the yellowpages. He must be [[suck cock|s-ing someone's d]] at twitter because they refuse to [[ban]] him even though they [[hypocrite|claim to be against it]].

[[file:Twitter_tos.JPG|center]]

[[File:Reality2k.gif|thumb|150px|left|Oh shit!]]
[[File:Chris_stone_delete_tweets.jpg|thumb|150px|EXTREEE, EXTREEE, READ ALL ABOUT IT!]]
Twitter may not be budging, but Chris got spooked [[last thursday]] when the shit hit the fan, and he [[delete fucking everything|deleted fucking everything]]. All but a few tweets remain, his website is up for auction with 0 bids, and his formspring is gone. His court case against livejournal was dismissed. Now he's hiding from the [[irl|actual]] police now, as apparently four different people are suing him.
