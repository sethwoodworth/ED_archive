''This is a woman?! Looks like Bill Clinton in drag!''

'''SlimVirgin<sup>[[✡]]</sup>''' (aka Linda Mack aka Sara McEwan) is [[not Jewish]]. She lives alone nowhere near any close relatives or close friends, in a one-horse town in the middle of the Canadian prairie, just with her two pullover-wearing poodles and a cat. She dyes her hair (compare the photo to the right and the photo to the left) and knows that the rest of her life, approximately 20 or 30 years, she will have to spend alone for having alienated the people around her, including her several ex-boyfriends, who she obsesses about and googles all day long. In her mini-sized living room she has five or ten books about Canadian English and British English stylistics and orthography, which she now knows by heart. She also has a cable TV Internet connection, which she will use to drown out her next 20 years of loneliness via Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, even lonely, unsociable hags in the middle of a vast, deserted Canadian fluvial plain. So she has added—click, click—people like lib/"neocon" extremist [[Chip Berlet]] and pornography distributor [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Jayjg|some extremist orthodox Jew somewhere in eastern North America]] to her "[[friends list]]". But she might as well delete them too.

But on Wikipedia, she is just known as a Wikipedia administrator, [[sockpuppet]]eer[http://antisocialmedia.net/?p=115][http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?showtopic=12097&hl=], [[Victim complex|professional victim]], and former [[spy]].

Around 1990, she betrayed her workmates at ABC Nooz in London by turning over their files to MI5 in order to frame an innocent man of the Lockerbie bombing. Cambridge [[fail|drop-out]] Linda bummed around Germany, Switzerland and France for a few years teaching English as a Second Language to unappreciative rich kids before moving home to Alberta and changing her name to Sarah in an ultimately doomed attempt to change her identity. Supposedly the SlimVirgin name is a reference to olive oil and her being a [[vegan|malnourished]] abstinence kook.  She [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daniel_Brandt&diff=prev&oldid=24251234 created] the article for Daniel Brandt on [[Wikipedia]] and has been dominating her [[The Wikipedia Jews|cohorts and minions]] ever since.  For a [[Lie|supposed virgin]], she is an expert [[attention whore]], having "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=prev&oldid=55692340 quit]" Wikipedia after a former [[ABC|ABC News]] coworker of hers revealed that one and a half decades before she had led Scotland Yard to raid the ABC News London office in order to confiscate the videotapes of the Libyan Lockerbie bombing suspects. SlimVirgin also [[Wikicide|left]] Wikipedia at the mere prospect of [[Linuxbeak]] allowing banned Wikipedia user and abusive ex-boyfriend [[Blu Aardvark]] to edit again. Alex Schnickerdoodle was quickly shot down, Blu Aardvark stayed banned, and there was much lulz to be had.

SlimVirgin is an animal rights activist yet she keeps two poodles in captivity.  She is also married to "animal-lover" [[WolfJLupus]], who she lets take care of her dog most of the day.  She owns several articles on the wiki, including ones on New Antisemitism, Animal Rights and [[PETA]] (People Eating Tasty Animals). Lo, the [[furry|fury]] that will descend upon anyone who tampers with her wikipossessions! She is one of the most despised characters on Wikipedia yet is able to rule with the help of Jayjg in the absence of King Jimbo I. This is comparable to the way Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan ruled MASH 4077 whenever Col. Blake or Col. Potter were away.

Why does anyone put up with her?  A: She puts out.

==The world according to Mack's propaganda==
[[Image:Linda Mack aka Sara McEwan.JPG|thumb|Holy sh-]]
Synopsis:
*The bombing of Dresden was OK.
*Bomb Iran. Now.
*Before you bomb Iran, take the feminists out of there. Let the others die.
*I love Israel.
*Palestine? What is Palestine?
*Which Lebanese civilians? Those are terrorists.
*I love Freud, Jung etc.
*I love feminist intellectualist artists.
*I love slim virgins (Loro Jonggrang). This proves that I don't hate all Indonesians, but only the Indonesian Muslim terrorists.
*I speak for the families of the Lockerbie bombing.
*Salinger was crazy and unfair. Good that he already died.
*Please don't experiment with animals, because the experiments might prove the ideas of psychiatry wrong.  
*I'm a multiculturalist, even though I only learned three words of French and German while I was teaching English around Western Europe, but I expect my language students to know more English.
*I love the data-mining Google does for North American and Western European intelligence agencies.
*Fuck Russia. Use EU/NATO color revolutions and Israel to democratize the fuck out of the Caucasus, Middle East, Iran and Central Asia. We need more oil from there.
*Libya/Iran did PA103.

==SlimVirgin's motivation: fetal alcohol syndrome, pro-psychiatry, and lack of a big, tumescent cock==
[[Image:Cup Size 30 AA.GIF|thumb|Cup size: 30 AA]]
SlimVirgin edits Wikipedia because she can't get over being fired by Salinger after acting like an [[attention whore]] after her first date bombed and after she was dumped by her Virginia boyfriend. That's also why she had to make a documentary about the Woodview "Nursing Home", aka madhouse, and why, on Wikipedia, she counters every view that might contradict [[Freud|Jewish pharmaceutical-sponsored psychiatry]]'s views of fetal alcohol syndrome, SlimVirgin's specialty, since she sees anti-psychiatry views as anti-[[bestiality|"animal rights"]] because of animal tests that supported anti-psychiatry hypotheses and since her shrink recommends her to use her poodles to replace her dates. Her sexual frustration also explains her support of Iranians, but only as long as they're eccentric anti-Iranian feminists and why she's sometimes perceived as supposedly "anti-Semitic" or "self-hating", since she uses other Jews to repair the damage caused by her sexual frustration. Her pro-madhouse view reflects her egalitarian "everyone's created equal, but Jews are still superior" view.

Before SlimVirgin was using the name "SlimVirgin" she edited under the name '''Slimv'''. Daniel Brandt also discovered that all edits by this username were immediately oversighted. One Wikipedia Review user found a [http://www.sapphireplace.com/stories/slimv/zyprexa.html lot of really bad porn] [http://www.sapphireplace.com/stories/slimv.html written by "Slimv"] and theorized that she might have sexual frustration. The characters in her stories are named "Jimmy" and "Danny" which lends credence to this theory.

==An example of how she manipulates and destroys her enemies==
[[Image:SlimVirgin5.JPG|thumb|left|SlimVirgin, bitchin' around]]
SlimVirgin also was secretly behind the false rumors that [[User:Igor Alexander|Igor Alexander]] Bergstein, the Jewish founder of [[The Wikipedia Review|The Holocaust Review]], was actually SlimVirgin's greatest fear, anti-feminist holocaust denier [[Alex Linder]].[http://wikipediareview.com/index.php?s=30578550011e68044787bd09bb6ada19&showtopic=11379&view=findpost&p=41232]  Most people still believe Igor is Alex Linder to this day, and Igor was excommunicated by his Jewish family and friends.

==Another example of how she manipulates and destroys her enemies==
SlimVirgin wanted to control lists of Jews, since she found out that [[Alex Linder]] has posted to [[Stormfront]] directly from the Jews list, and she didn't want them to attack anyone who wasn't actually a Jew.  Because of this, she attacked [[the beautiful people]], getting them banned, insisting that nobody can be that beautiful, and hence that they must all be the same person, then banning [[Runcorn]] as well, purely because he had sock puppets in the latest [[Harry Potter]] book, which SlimVirgin had got insider knowledge of from [[Malber]], who is J K Rowling's nanny.

==This is funny because it's true==
[[Image:SlimVirgin since 00.JPG|thumb|130px|Making enemies since '00]]
If SlimVirgin gives you an indef block, and then someone else [[unblock]]s saying that you'll have to provide an actual reason, then the unblocking admin gets told that they are wheel warring and is threatened with losing their sysop powers. If then 20 other admins ask SlimVirgin to unblock, and she says no I won't allow it, then it counts as a community ban. If then another 10 more admins say that they will now unblock, and arbcom says that it should be unblocked, then all that SlimVirgin needs to do is to get someone who supports her to write that that user is never to be unblocked, and then disables e-mail. Isn't that right Yamla?

And then they call that a community [[Banned|ban]].

==Spy allegations suppressed by the [[Web 2.0]] lynch mobs and the Name Redacted advocates==
[[Image:Slim_virgin_avatar.jpg|thumb|A whole psyops company designs SlimVirgin's avatars and page decorations; this one from [http://www.wikback.com a rilly stupid Wikipedia fan site] says "One eyebrow so '''I am not Linda''' and '''you will protect and love me."]]

[http://www.geocities.com/Berlet_archive/virgin.htm Former co-worker:]

:''I was no longer based in London when it happened, but in 1991-92, after Salinger had traveled to Tripoli and successfully interviewed the two Libyan suspects (before their move to Netherlands), Special Branch of Scotland Yard demanded all of our tapes (including those not broadcast). Salinger came to believe that Linda was working for MI-5 and had been from the beginning; assigned genuinely to investigate Panam 103, but also to infiltrate and monitor us. ABC refused to hand over the tapes and other documents the Brits wanted; Special Branch raided our office and Salinger blamed Linda for this. (At two subsequent trials, ABC lost an expensive court case and had to hand over tapes and documents, none of which contained any conclusive evidence about the Libyans). At this point Salinger fired Linda and locked her out of the office, after she had been spreading some malicious rumors about him.''

==Ways SlimVirgin makes Wikipedia suck==
[[Image:Linda and Jayjg.jpg|thumb|HOW BOUT A CHECKUSER FOR FISHING MAH GURL]]
[[Image:Clipper Maid of the Seas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Slimv's "family" (= two-week date)]]

SlimVirgin runs a [[cabal]] of [[Dungeons and Dragons|high-level]] administrators who come to her aid. The previously mentioned [[Jayjg]], runs CheckUser (in violation of WikiMedia policies) for anyone who criticizes her. She has a [[sockpuppet]] admin, Crum375, who she brings out to make controversial edits, bans and blocks, and who comes to every talk page dispute involving SlimVirgin.

Slimmy plays a control game on Wikipedia in order to maintain her power structure. Even though she runs her own sockpuppet admin, and uses an oversight delete whenever her own IP is disclosed, she has proposed [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:CheckUser_policy#Proposal_to_conduct_random_checks_on_RfAs] that new admin candidates be subject to CheckUser.  She regularly sabotages new users who would like administrator rights if they disagree with her wiki-politics [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Gracenotes].

In the power struggle, she's always trying to create a hierarchy of users. She wholeheartedly rejects Jimbo's statement that adminship is no big deal and the meatball essay warning against vested contributors [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?VestedContributor]. She wrote, and endorsed, a proposed policy [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editing_policy_pages&diff=53877749&oldid=53877023] that only administrators could edit policy pages. Other times she has endorsed editcount based restrictions for even making a point on discussion pages.

Slimmy is a master at gaming the rules.  All of the original core policy pages (Original Research, Neutral Point of View, Reliable sources, etc) were simple declarations of intent for the first several years of Wikipedia. They were very stable, at less than a few hundred edits between them.  In early 2005 Slimmy decided to re-write the core policies to her vision. The policies have now, each of them, undergone ''thousands'' of edits. These thousands of edits are the result of daily revert wars between Slimmy and her socks, and sensible people trying to make sense of it all.  They cannot be declared stable.  They have been re-written to be hard rules of things you can't do, instead of the simple declarations of intent for editors to interpret with common sense.  Of course in any rules lawyer dispute over "the rules" the author of the rules will triumph as she and her socks do. 

Since it is difficult, even for someone as entrenched as Slimey, to make large wholesale changes to the policies at one time she has mastered some strategies to accomplish it via subterfuge.  Her second strategy after bullying using her cabal consorts is to create different and conflicting rules in two or more policy pages, one of which is the version she prefers.  Then a month or so later, she re-writes the other page to "reconcile" all of the policy pages to her preference.

If [[you]] create an article about a small hamlet named Swalwell you will join the ranks of the permabanned instantly. The article gets automatically marked as "trolling" (LOL) and deleted by Crum375, one of her many meatpuppets.


===As Crum375===
[[Image:Slimsock.png|thumb|100px|SlimVirgin with her favorite sockpuppet.]]
Whenever SlimVirgin knows she screwed up big that she's too embarrassed to war over herself, she calls out her puppet Crum375 to do the work. Whenever she gets in [[old media|the news]], she goes hiding and Crum375 does the edit warring and reverting any mention of it. When it came to light all the abuse she did to support [[Gary Weiss]] (esp. abusing Cla68), she avoided the issue entirely and let Crum375 go to work.

==New York Times Magazine Buttsexing of Slim==
On July 1, 2007, SlimeVermin took a shot of cum in the ass from the New York Times Magazine, who totally called her out as the most biased of all Wikipedians, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/magazine/01WIKIPEDIA-t.html?pagewanted=5&_r=1 because of her zoophilia] (see page 5 of 6). The New York Times Magazine also asserts ED as an authoritative source on SlimVirgin!

{{quote | He associates certain user names with certain political biases, and he recalls an online dustup with someone called Slimvirgin over whether the Animal Liberation Front was a terrorist organization.

==OhmyNews==
On July 26, 2007, twenty-five days after the New York Times Magazine article, SlimeVermin took yet another blob of ejaculate in the rectum, this time from the Seoul citizen journalism Web site OhmyNews, entitled ''[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?no=374006&rel_no=1 Wikipedia and the Intelligence Services]''.

This was covered by [[Slashdot]] on July 27 [http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/07/27/1943254.shtml], by Reddit on July 27 [http://reddit.com/info/29s6r/comments/c29tcg], by [[Digg]] on July 28 [http://digg.com/tech_news/Are_Intelligence_Agencies_Secretly_Censoring_Wikipedia?t=8128773], and in the Wikipedia Signpost on July 30 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2007-07-30/In_the_news], with an admission by [[Jimbo Wales]] that the story was true [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-July/078336.html], yet still Wikipedia claims that it is entirely fabricated.

==Penis-waving from a feministic "[[attack|Position of Pseudo-Wikness]]"==
Five days after the OhmyNews article, Slim uploaded a [[shoop]]ped self-portrait for Encyclopædia Dramatica readers to contemplate. (Note: The real SV is not a 12-year-old girl, though she has a body like one, which may explain her popularity among Wikipedia's pre-teen and pedophilic editors and admins.)

Even if your fears felt completely irrational, I'd like to hear about them.''

:''I'd also like to hear from women who feel they were subjected to additional harassment because of their sex, or from gays and members of ethnic minorities who feel they were picked on in whole or in part because of that.''

:''Many thanks,''

Most of the responses she received were complaints that she and her cronies were cyberstalking them.
