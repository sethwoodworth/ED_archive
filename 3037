'''#fortune''' is a [[forced meme]] (forced on [[4chan]] by [[moot]]) where by typing '''#fortune''' into the name field of another of 4chan's forums submitting a post there and returning to /b/, one of a dozen-or-so, random Fortune Cookie type fortunes is generated automatically. This, of course, provides much [[anti-lulz|hilarity]] for the [[gaiafag]]s of [[B|/b/]] (who have figured it out) when [[newfag]]s come lurking and start crying "How do I shot '''#fortune'''?"  Placing a fortune in a post before text can also serve as a means of demonstrating that one is not a newfag, as newfags commonly do not know how.
