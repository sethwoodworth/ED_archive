The [[trolls|kind people]] at '''[[EQ2Flames]]' [[Nagafen]]''' server came up with a generous way to [[Troll|assist]] [[newbies]] in ''[[EverQuest II]]''. Then a good fellow called Pudaan decided to share it at [http://eq2.wikia.com/wiki/EverQuest_2_Wiki:Main_Page EQ2i], the EQ2 [[Wiki]], titled as '''"This [[Sic|isnt]] sea world"'''. However, the [[admins]] there are being a bunch of [[fags]] and have deleted this important piece of [[Fake|information]]! Since we here at [[ED]] want you to get the most out of your [[EQ2]] [[Retarded|experience]], we have [[Copypasta|mirrored]] this for your enjoyment.

# Head to [[Africa|Fens of Nathsar]], it is off Kylong plains which is accessible from [[Africa|Commonlands]] docks or [[England|Antonica]] docks. Take the boat from one of those docks to Kylong Plains. After arriving in Kylong head north. Map of the area - [[Image:Kylong_map.jpg]]
# After arriving in Fens of Nathsar you need to head to the Isle of the Forgotten Ape, this is a dangerous run but if you are careful even a level 10 can make it there virtually unharmed, Map of the area - [[Image:Fens_map.jpg]]
# Once on the island head to the Northern most tip, loc(-1,410, -412, -2,939) Once here you must wait for the boat that comes everyday at around 4am gametime. This portion of the quest is known to bug out and skip a day or two, just keep waiting and the boat will eventually show up. Don't worry about the [[Travis the Killer Chimp|monkey]] he won't attack you. The [[Travis the Killer Chimp|Tangrin]] is a raid mob that spawns every week but there is also a spawnable version that we will use for this quest.

# A few boats will arrive as you can see on the [[Screencap|screenshot]], once the large boat comes closer to shore you will be able to board. Once on board talk to [[Vince Offer|Lucius Wavedancer]] for the quest Monkey Business. [[Image:Wavedancer.jpg]]
# Once you receive the quest Monkey Business from [[Vince|Lucius]] the real fun starts, Lucius will give you the item an oddly shaped whistle

# After receiving the whistle from Lucius you must purchase some fresh bananas from another merchant on the same boat, his name is Floppies T`Pain, the bananas are 10 silver each. [[Image:Fresh_banana.jpg]]
# Stand anywhere on the ape island and play your whistle (if you turn your [[music]] up you can actually hear a rough tune of "Tempted by the fruit of another" by [[Fat Larry's Band|Squeeze]]) This will summon the quest version of The Tangrin and also take a banana from your inventory. Once The Tangrin spawns he starts going [[RAGE|apeshit]] on the boats that are docked up, you have 5 minutes to run around the island and find a [[I'm on my bee|beehive]]. It is a harvestable bush that can randomly [[Shit|spawn]] anywhere on the island.

# Once you have the beehive in your inventory find tangrin by the boats and right click the item and use it on [[Travis the Killer Chimp|Tangrin]], this will make bee's swarm around his face and cause him to cease attacking the boats and run into the ocean.
# Once the boat is freed you can get back on board and talk to Lucius again, he is very grateful for the defense of the boat and offers you a ride back to Freeport or Qeynos to complete your [[Boston|betrayal ]]quest.


==Rewards==
* Betrayal to either Qeynos or Freeport
