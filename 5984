The '''Olympic Flame''' is something that has been carried in a [[protest|procession]] as part of a [[cult|ritual]] for [[less than 9000|2,800]] years (although the modern version was invented in [[Nazi]] [[Germany]] by [[Hitler]] himself) and was carried through [[London]] on the 6th of April 2008.
[[Image:12pm.jpg|thumb|left|Be there. 12pm. 9th part of the procession, torch is being carried by a little Chinese lady.]]

It all started with a thread on [[Ebaumsworld]] in which ballsy Anons suggested that it might be [[win]] to attempt to extinguish the Olympic Torch. Little did Anon realize, however, that they were not the first people to formulate such a notion. The human rights activists wanted to [[pwn]] the torch to bring attention to China's shitty human rights record. Every country with an axe to grind with the Chinks wanted to douse the torch in order to win publicity for their own cause. Anon wanted to do it because it would be [[lulz|funny.]] Before long it became clear that every fucker with a chip on their shoulder was dead-set on putting the damn thing out.

The torch's subsequent journey across the globe was replete with violence, arrests, attempted self-immolation and all-round shits n' giggles. What China had hoped would be a major breakthrough in convincing the world that they weren't complete cunts had turned into an intractable publicity disaster wasting millions upon millions of dollars, leaving a swath of cities blinking in bemusement and wondering how they had been conned into allowing the torch through in the first place and leading to the premiers of [[England]] and [[Germany]] boycotting the opening ceremony.

While evidence of Anon's involvement is limited at best, it falls to us to chronicle the epic lulz that ensued and say [[GG]] to all involved.

==Feasibility==
Official news reports suggested that somewhere in the vicinity of 2,000 police offers would be guarding the procession through London. They expected [[Protest|protestfags]] shouting "FREE [[Tibet|TIBET]]", but their protest would be peaceful. Anonymous could use [[Rickroll]] to protest peacefully, but if they wanted to be truly [[porn|hardcore]], one anon could go down as a [[an hero|martyr]] if they felt they had the [[balls]] to. However, this would probably have serious [[lulz|repercussions]] on a wider scale if it ever did, by chance, actually happen. It is well known that the Olympics is funded with [[Scientology]] [[so cash|cash]], therefore it makes sense to boycott it.

The [[anti-lulz|bad news]] was that the flame itself was protected against extreme weather. The external flame was kept alive by an inner flame which was gas-powered. Extreme measures were needed if this is to be successful.

==Battle Plan==
[[Image:Anonymous_blastoise.jpg|thumb|Don't fuck with this motherfucker; he'll put out the Olympic Flame in no time.]]

#Anons get CO2 fire extinguishers (Protip: The use of any other type will be ineffective, the use of type B fire extinguishers will result IRL B&hammer due to high levels of [[AIDS]] in the chemical powder).
#Anons inter-mingle-a-fiels with surrounding crowd and using [[Pwnt|pwnage]] [[hax]] social skills gets close to the torch.
#Anons are scattered all along the planned route to ensure maximum lulz and efficiency (Protip2: if 1 anon gets V& others will be on hand later in the route to give /b/lackup - anon is legion).
#In the event you win, enjoy the lulz as you will be the [[epic]] and the cure to the [[cancer]] that is killing /b/.
#OPTION TYEM?
#*a. Steal torch for win whilst shouting random memes.
#*b. use CO2 extinguishers to put fail on [[China|China's]] torch of [[AIDS]].
#*c. get tazed whilst saying something stupid which becomes a meme.
#*d. [[final solution|FINAL SOLUTION]] 
#In the event of mission [[fail]], you will be [[Party van|B& IRL]] and [[Don't Taze Me Bro|tazed by a bro]] along with the other FREE-[[Tibet|TIBET]] peoples (make sure to blame [[ebaums]]).

==The First Attack==

[[Image:Olympicflame.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Bitches don't know|Bitches just don't know]].]]
[[Image:Konniehuq.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The outline of her [[tits|breasts]] are visible in this pic, despite her claiming to be a Muslim.]]
[[Image:Wheniwasolympicguy.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[WHEN I WAS]], A YOUNG BOY, [[Tibet|TIBET]] WAS STILL FREE OF COMMUNISTS]]
[[Image:Tibet372.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[X is now a meme|THIS PICTURE IS NOW A MEME!]] ]]

A [[Tibet|Tibetfag]] tried to grab the flame from the Arab British TV presenter Konnie Huq. Since Anon stated that the first person to attack the flame would become a meme, he is now a meme. Reports suggest that fire extinguishers were used, which suggests the presence of Anonymous given that was their main battle tactic. She is thought to be of a higher [[Aryan|caste]] than most of the people of India or Bangladesh, because she is actually a [[Muslim]], lol, [[srsly]], even check [[TOW]]. However it is well known that South Asian women are probably the least attractive women in the world and that it is right that they only [[sex|mix]] with Arab.

==The Second Wave==
? Some [[britfag]] dressed up as a Jew (impersonating an officer) tried to extinguish the flame (not anon) and got [[Jail|b& IRL]].

The filth were out in packs (covered in chink feces) keeping Free-[[Tibet]] (and Anon) protesters away from the torch. "Around 200" filths had created a black person barricade to separate them from the torch and help the Co$fags and [[China|Chinafags]], but Anon was [[Legion]] and broke through.

The torch was protected by about 20 [[China|chinafag]] bodyguards who had [[Ebaums]] trolls who were holding up [[China]] flags all around Trafalgar Square. 

The media were working for the [[Jews]] and giving screen time only to [[China|chinkys]] and stopping Anon and Free-[[Tibet|Tibetfags]] from hacking their screens.

The Olympic Flame was [[pwned]] in [[France]] by [[Tibet|tibetfags]] and had to be re-lit several times, causing massive [[butthurt]] to those carrying it.

[[Anonymous]] was denied [[lulz]] because of this faggotry.  Thanks a lot, [[douchebag|douchebags]].

Also:  [[Obama|Obama's]] bitch, Majora Carter, was a torchbearer in the SF run [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080409/ap_on_re_us/olympic_torch who got KO'd out of the race (13th paragraph down)] by chinky stinkys who didn't like her raping China and [[Scientology|Co$fags]].

[[Fail]].


On the bright side, at least the mayor of Buenos Aires [[Serious Business|confirmed for brawl]] by the sheer number of security employed to guard the Flame (second only to India's confirmation on April 17th); if only they tried that on the Falklands.

[[image:rivaltorch.jpeg|thumb|120px|right|The Free Tibet Drama Flame]]
<b>The Plans & the Reality</b>
*<b>Here the [[Epic Win]] Plan:</b>  We interrupt the Olympic torch relay as it moves through the streets of [[India|New Delhi]] today from the presidential palace to the India Gate war memorial. The Blue Man Kung Fu Squad will only consist of two [[China|Bluefags]] to make the Epic Win Plan a big success.

*<b>Here the [[Fail]] Plan:</b>  All Metro stations and roads in the surrounding area have been shut down, and more than 15,000 security personnel have been deployed to police the short 1.8 miles route (was originally shortened to 2.5 miles, but shortened again for [[lemon party|Grandma and Grandpa]]). 

*<b>Here What Happens, Part I:</b>  Thousands of Tibetan exiles marched through New Delhi early morning on April 17th to protest against Chinese policies in their homeland, hours before the Olympic torch was due to be paraded through the city. Chanting "Stop the killing in Tibet" and waving Tibetan flags, about [[300|3,000]] Tibetans joined the protests, along with Indian politicians, Westerners, Burmese activists and supporters of Falun Gong. They also carried a [http://specials.rediff.com/news/2008/apr/17video.htm "Torch for Tibet"].

*<b>Here What Happens, Part II:</b>  At least 30 were arrested after storming the hotel in New Delhi where the torch was housed, and another 30 were hustled away by police from in front of the Chinese consulate in Mumbai. Along with mass demonstrations in New Delhi and Mumbai, an estimated [[300|30,000]] had gathered in Bangalore and thousands more in the Hindu spiritual capital of Varanasi to protest China's human rights record, in particular its treatment of Tibet.

India Relay Leg ends, 180 Tibetan protesters arrested. In Nepal, police arrested at least 500 protesters as they protested outside the Chinese Embassy.

Epic Win for teh "Torch for Tibet" Relay.

==Chinese Gangbang in Bangkok==
The Flame [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEtQD-yS0Xp4_sizYjZ8SE7bG_1gD9053RC00 had yet another smooth run] through Thailand's capital city of Bangkok, with a huge party and [[delicious cake]] for all, even the foreigners who were warned that if they fired their [[mudkip|hydro cannon]] at the Flame, they would be [[banhammer|Bangkoked]] from Thailand immediately.

Before the flame made this particular run, [http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=63fbb3fd-905b-494f-b0f9-d31c2f12fb92&&Headline=Thai+PM+calls+hosting+Torch+an+honour Thailand Prime Minister Samak Sundravej] had this particularly lulzy statement to make:

{{quote|Whoever tries to destroy the flame is crazy and unreasonable. Why would anyone protest in Thailand? Why don't they protest in China?|Thai Prime Minister Sundravej, clearly missing the point}}

Alas, this was about as lulzy as this run was going to be, as the [[Bridget|Thaitraps]] were too busy sucky-sucky Chinese cock for five dollah to give the rest of the world a good show of lulz.

==MaGAYsia:  Totally China Jr.==
[[image:malgaysia_protesters.jpeg|thumb|120px|right|Malgaysia Protesters]]

Not only were the [[Malaysia|Magaysiafags]] [[I Came|just ecstatic]] to have the Flame come to Kuala Lamepur, but when a few [[Japan|Japanfags]] opted to be Protestfags, the new Chinafags [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEtQD-yS0Xp4_sizYjZ8SE7bG_1gD9069ML80 opted for a lulzy beatdown] with [[dildos|inflated plastic batons]] before Malay Police took them, a Buddhist monk and a [[London|Luldonhag]] into custody for a short time. 

The only good thing to happen here was when [[God]] decided to [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gj9veMd1ninWHBKXIgkvRQmG_MUQ fire his mudkip at the Flame].  Whether he was able to do what so many [[Anonymous|Anon]] have tried before with little success, only He knows for sure.

==Jakarta Uses Mudkips...But Not on the Flame==
[[image:jakartarelay.jpeg|thumb|120px|right|Relay in Jakarta]]
Just like it was in Pakistan, the Flame ran around the city's main sport stadium under heavy guard at an invitation-only event. Unlike Pakistan, however, officials in the Indonesian city [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gEtQD-yS0Xp4_sizYjZ8SE7bG_1gD9078JNG0 confirmed for brawl], arresting protestfags left and right, stealing their Tibetflags, and deploying their own [[mudkips]] and [[over 9000|over 3,000]] police officers to [[Scientology|handle]] the chaos outside the invitation-only Flame circle jerk.

The truly lulzy part of all this, however, is that in general, the [[pirate|Indoasspirates]] just don't give a fuck about the Olympics; just as they were the only ones not to televise the 2004 Games in Athens, no one was interested in paying for the television rights to see the Flame do a little dance around the stadium. So, in a way, Jerkoffa was kinda [[win]].  Not epic win, but win nonetheless.

And of course, [[God]] once again fired his mudkip at the flame, but doused the already-soaked protestfags and [[China|Chinafags]] instead.  You win some, you lose some.

[[image:chinamafiagang.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Bitches don´t know about me and my Mafia]]

It was [http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/23/torch.relay.canberra/index.html Flame On] in [[Canberra]] as the Olympic Flame made its way through Australia's capital during the 10-mile relay where thousands turned out for what would turn out to be a lulzy day out.

The day began shortly before the Flame was to make its run, when the [[China|Chinafags]], who days earlier requested major blackup from all over Australia to be sure disruptions were kept to a minimum, as many as 20,000 members of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association were bused in from Sydney and Melbourne to help drown out and intimidate anyone with designs on protesting their homeland's record on human rights, took on the outnumbered and outgunned [[Islam|Muslimfags]]--repping their homeboys in China--and the [[Tibet|Tibetfags]] where at least two were arrested by the [[Police|Canberra Alien Patrol]], including one of the few Tibetfag who decided to make their own Flame by torching a Chinese flag.

During the relay itself, a Tibetfag to took the sky and wrote "Free Tibet" with his plane, which is a shame as he really should've buzzbombed the Flame with a big-ass water balloon instead. The closest anyone came to doing just that, however, was a Protestfag who leaped out in front of the Flame and [[doing it wrong|sat down]] to stop it; he was quickly taken away by the Alien Patrol.

Away from the route, three Tibethags blocked the street in front of Parliament, while another Protestfag kept shouting "stop the killing in Tibet." Again, the Alien Patrol swept them up and deported them back to Mars.

Finally, the Alien Patrol [http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080424/ts_afp/chinaunresttibetrightsoly2008torch had their hands full] with the [[douchebag|Bluefags]], fighting over who was in charge of the securing the Flame, even getting into a shoving match at one point before the Alien Patrol told the Bluefags to [[Kitchen|gb2kitchen]].

<b>The results</b>
*At least seven Protestfags sent back to Mars by the Canberra Alien Patrol

A North Korean defector tried to set himself on fire to halt the Olympic torch relay, but thousands of Police riding horses and bicycles turned out to guard it along its 24-km route. The man who tried to immolate himself, 45-year-old Son Jong Hoon had led an unsuccessful public campaign to save his brother from execution in the North, where he was accused of spying after the two met secretly in China. About an hour into the relay, Son poured gasoline on himself and tried to set himself on fire, but police stopped him.

==[[China|Hong Kong]] [[Hitler|deports]] [[Canada]] and [[England|Brit]] Jew==

The deportation from Hong Kong of a Toronto pro-Tibetan activist, along with another Canadian and a Briton, for planning to protest during the Olympic torch relay has surprised and angered her friends at home.
On Saturday, three Danish human rights Jew were detained and deported from Hong Kong.

[[image:deported_fail_jews.jpeg|thumb|120px|left|Typical Treatment of Olympic Jews by Hitler]]
Tsering Lama, an organizer with Students for a Free Tibet and a well-known member of Toronto's Tibetan community, was deported upon arrival at the territory's airport yesterday, activists said.

{{squote|<b>It's totally shameful,You can see how much they're spooked, that they're deporting travelers.</b>| Gelek Badheytsang, a friend who has collaborated with her on several pro-Tibet protests}}

Also turned away were Kate Woznow, a Halifax native who now lives in New York and organizes for the same pro-Tibetan group as Lama, and Matt Whitticase, a Briton with the Free Tibet Campaign.

It was the second known instance in which activists have been denied entry ahead of the Olympic torch's arrival in Hong Kong today. The flame's return to Chinese soil, at the start of Beijing's 100-day countdown to the Games, follows a global tour marred by protests against Beijing's human rights record and its recent crackdown in Tibet.

The grounds for the latest deportations weren't immediately clear. Hong Kong officials have said repeatedly they won't discuss individual cases.

Woznow said she was put on a return flight to New York. Whitticase was sent to London. It was unclear yesterday where Lama, who has family in Nepal, was sent.
Woznow accused the Hong Kong government of caving in to pressure from Beijing.

==Below zero [[Drama]] at highest Mountain==

[[image:everest_torch.jpeg|thumb|right|Everest Meeting]]

"One World, One Dream!", the official slogan of the Beijing Olympics.Really?...well yes, but the World is not [[China]], and the "one dream" of China may not be the same Dream of the rest of us.

Taking the torch to Mount Everest (8848 m) was the most ambitious part of what has become the longest and most [[Fail|controversial]] Olympic torch relay in history.
Chinese climbers carrying the Olympic flame reached the summit of Mount Everest [[Last Thursday]] in a bellow zero [[Drama]] for the Chinese Tv. 

The Chinese and Tibetan climbers taking the Olympic torch to the top of Mount Everest saw mysterious lights as they scaled the world's highest peak,they reported. 
 
Strong Winds, Mysterious Lights and the low Oxygen Level near to the heavenly Universe were not able to destroy the fucking special made in China damn torch at the highest Mountain of our world. And Even for the drunk Nyalmot [[Yeti]], it was too cold to steal the torch. In better weather conditions, he would try for the [[Lulz]] ,he said.

According to legends, there are three species: 
the Rimi (some 2.5 m), the Nyalmot (4.5 m) and the Raksi-Bombo (1.5 m). In spite of differences in size, the species have a general resemblance. The Yeti has reddish hair (although others claim it is gray), smells terrible and it is very strong (it throws boulders as if they were pebbles). It makes an ululating or whistling sound, and is sometimes heard roaring like a lion. The Yeti is rumored to be very fond of strong alcoholic drinks.

==Wise Fag Summary and the Strategy to Flame Off==
[[Image:OH EXPLOITABLE olympics raid.jpg|thumb|[[Oh exploitable]] (done in [[MS Paint]])]]
The [[London|Luldonfags]] weren't able to deliver, the [[Paris|Parisfags]] pwned the Flame, the [[Americunts|Amerifags]] were denied in [[San Francisco]], and the [[Argentina|Argentinafags]] lived up to their rep of not making a damn difference in the world.

Meanwhile, [[Borat|Borat's]] [[ghey]] cousins in [[Tanzania]], Oman and Pakistan threw [[lemon party|a huge sausage party]] in honor of the [[fag|Chinese Blue Flame Brigade]], which finally ended when the supercool [[Penis Pump|Penis Pumpers]] in India turned New Dehli into [[THUNDERDOME|Thunderdome]].

Next, the Chinese made some [[Stick_It_In_Her_Pooper|sweet pooper lovin']] to the [[Bridget|Thaitraps]] and the [[Malaysia|Magaysiafags]] while the [[Pirate|Indoasspirates]] just didn't give a fuck about a stupid Flame and the private circle jerk held in its honor while it was in their country.  

Then, the [[Australia|Australiafags]] got a gangland-style beatdown by the [[China|Chinafags]] while the [[Canberra|Canberra Alien Patrol]] got into a shoving match with the [[douchebag|Bluefags]] surrounding the runners.  The violence would follow the Chinafags into [[Japan]], where [[Ninjas]] did everything they could to put out the Flame and take out as much faggotry as possible.

Further, the Flame ran through the [[Good Korea]]/[[Evildoer Korea]] gauntlet, where one Good Koreafag nearly Flamed On himself before the police stopped him, before heading north to [[Vietnam]], where Rambo tried to make a grab for the torch, but as far as we know, is still waiting for that damn helicopter to come pick his ass up.

And finally, the Flame came home to the [[goatse|open arms]] and [[dongs|big smiles]] of its gay homosexual lover, [[China]].

There no one else left now. It's over.

Below is the advice [[Wise beard man|the Wise Fag]] bestowed upon many Anon wanting to Flame Off:

# Use fire extinguishers for range attack. You can't out-melee all those [[China|Bluefags]] around the runner and Bruce Lee is fucking dead, so /thread.
# Actually use your water balloons. Apparently all the [[London|Luldonfags]] used them for [[birth control]], thus explaining why we didn't see shit on April 6th.
# Stop fucking your [[mudkip]] and bring it with you; it has a dramatic effect in turning the tide.  If you love it, let it go.[[image:free_tibet.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Jesus of the Olympic Flame and Honorable Freeman of [[Paris|Paris]]]]
# Bring a water gun if necessary; it's your last resort. If all your bombs fail, use your sidearm; it's much faster than reloading.
# Group up, plot this shit, get the routes right, hope no one changes them at the last moment, don't go alone.
# Rig a camera and pretend you are a camera man, get close to the torch, launch your water missile.
# Get high ground, unleash the rage of /b/ from above.
# If an Anon actually gets a hold of the torch, immediately throw it on the ground as soon as you hold it.  Don't wave it around like a [[an hero|jackass]]; you will only get [[Pwned|thrown down]].
# If all else fails, do what the Indians did and go [[Waco|apeshit]] all over your local Chinese embassy.
# Remember, [[300|300 Spartans]] fucked up a shitload of Persians; you, too, can be [[an hero]].
# DO IT FAGGOTS!!! 
# [[????|??????]] 
# [[PROFIT!]]
