'''klik. BOMF.''' is the ritualized killing of failed [[memes]] or forced [[memes]] done by one of two [[anime|Pleinairs]] on [[4chan]]'s /[[b]]/.

Pleinair can turn most fail into win, execution-style by shooting whatever it is in the head with a grenade. Included among her victims have been [[Milhouse]], [[Rita]] (multiple times), countless [[furries]], [[Jack Spicer]] and many more.

The bottom line is that the [[OP]] would post a [[forced meme]] (e.g Milhouse) with a caption such as "guise can I be a meme yet?", to which Pleinar would immediately post the image sequence corresponding to Milhouse with the corresponding dialogue of "klik". then "BOMF" with a possible following "blerg" or "whdd" depending on what happened to the body afterwords. 

Klik bomf can be posted as a combo for profit, although even when the combo is broken, it still works. It must only be done by surprise. Unlike Mari-tan's KRAK! klik-BOMF must be customized each time and cannot be cut and pasted. As a result they are quite rare, and only used in cases of extreme fail or [[4chan]] faggotry.
