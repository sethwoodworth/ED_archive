==Who is Grace Note?==
{{tinyquote|If Grace Note does one more thing at all, then I am going to ban his ass for good|[[Ambi]] on '''Grace Note'''}}

Grace Note created the fake name of "Freddy Vessant" after reading about [http://www.ausfish.com.au/vforum/archive/index.php/t-65848.html The Irish Phonetic Alphabet], where it says "F for Vessant". He combined this with the Wheel of Fortune saying "F for Freddy" to make "Freddy Vessant". Yet Grace Note protested that his real name was revealed by [[Mistress Selina Kyle]] so much that then [[Wikipedia Review]] chief administrator [[Blu Aardvark]] actually de-adminned Selina for daring to reveal Grace Note's "real name". Good on you for protesting your fake name, Grace Note. Here's a sticker.

Grace Note first rose to prominence in protesting the secretive under the table ban of [[Poetlister]]. SlimVirgin had justified the Poetlister block by declaring that the whole lot of them were fucking neo-nazis, although she made sure that Jayjg was actually the one saying it.  So Grace Note took this opportunity to leap to the defence of the one who he hated and defended SlimVirgin for all she was worth by declaring on Wikipedia Review that on top of all of the banned users being neo-nazi anti-semites, that Wikipedia Review founder Igor Alexander was in fact Amelikite who was in fact [[Alex Linder]]. To this day Grace Note insists that this had absolutely nothing at all to do with his being about to be banned, and that he really was a neo-nazi.

Grace Note is famous for being far more insane than any suggestions of insanity about any of Wikipedia Review's members.  Grace Note has accused [[Blu Aardvark]], Qwerty, Lir, Selina, Blissyu2, and Somey of being [[Holocaust|holocaust deniers]].

{{squote|I stopped enjoying [[trolling]], because I could simply have written a [[bot]] to do it for me, and got the same results. I stopped having any thrill from [[Poetry|writing]], because I stopped hoping it would ever receive an audience. I stopped making [[music]] because it became clear to me that the outcome was embarrassing and awful. [[Asexual|I have never enjoyed sex]], but the realisation of how little I get from it grew to the point that I started thinking of it as something like [[Food|eating]] -- which I do not enjoy at all, particularly given the paucity of things that are actually good to eat [[Brisbane|in this place]]. Even [[masturbation]] became boring, because I stopped being able to [[Fantasy|fantasise]], and I had always enjoyed that. Now I cannot construct fantasies that I enjoy, only wan pictureshows that do not enliven, and seem unreal and unhappy|'''Grace Note'''}}

==HOWTO:Grace Note==
Grace Note is a master of strawman fallacies, [[Michael Moore|selective quotation]] and [[ad homine]] attacks. Below is an example of how a comment on logical reasoning becomes OMG HOLOCAUST DENIER.

'''Prima''':
<pre>Of course, it is a stretch of the imagination to believe that, but then again stranger things have happened. There's been too much evidence brought forward to suggest it really. But if you do believe that the holocaust didn't happen, it doesn't make you a racist, or an anti-semite. It might make you illogical, it might make you a bit stupid, but that in itself is not a racist sentiment." and "Whilst Hitler's tactics weren't quite the same, that was along the lines of what he was doing. It was manipulation. It was pushing people from the accepted facts towards racism and atrocities without really realising that they were doing it.</pre>

'''Grace Note''':
<pre>Comments such as these are typical of Holocaust deniers, who maintain that Jews were placed into concentration camps for their political activities rather than their ethnicity, and that the bodies found at concentration camps were dead of "natural" causes and were not the victims of a deliberate program of extermination.</pre>

At one point Grace Note decided to create his own forum for criticism of Wikipedia, to demonstrate that he was a real serious critic!  Sadly, it never got beyond [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Grace_Note&direction=next&oldid=50089632 a sub page on Wikipedia], which he doesn't even link to anymore.  It did, however, lead some to suspect that he might be the person behind [[Wikitruth]].  

Grace Note is famous for giving Wikipedia Review credibility, by proving that no matter how insane its members are, they couldn't hold a candle to him.
