Taking elements from [[hip-hop]] culture and car surfing, '''Ghost Riding''' is an updated form of that decades-old tradition that involves teenage boys doing retarded and drunken things with their cars once they reach the age of sixteen.

==History==
[[Image:Ghostride21.jpg|thumb|175px|Patrick Swize]]
[[Image:Ghostride7.jpg|thumb|175px|E-40 invented GRA (Ghost Riders Anonymous)]]
Car surfing originally gained wide popularity in the mid 1980s due to such movies as “Footloose” and “Teen Wolf” where characters in those movies would ride on moving cars.  Because American youths are stupid and believe they are invulnerable, and also because most kids want to be movie stars, they emulated these stunts, causing several accidents and mishaps.  It is because of such accidents [[Darwin Awards|experts believe that the fad wore out]].  A more likely answer is that some other idiotic fad supplanted car surfing.

During the late 1990’s the fad regained popularity due to such movies as “The Matrix” and television shows like “Jackass” where people were encouraged to hurt themselves for fame.  Now, because of such songs as E-40’s “Tell Me When to Go” and Mistah F.A.B’s “Ghost Ride It” the trendy craze continues.

==Sydeshows==

{{quote|They think they're hip, they can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere.|Bill Cosby, speaking on hip-hop culture.}}

Sydeshows (or Sideshows) are meetings where kids get together with their parent’s cars, set up their boom boxes, play E-40 as loud as they can, and proceed to destroy as much property as is humanly possible in the shortest amount of time.  At sydeshows, the goal actually seems to be to fail.

{{quote|Ghost ride was started not to see people succeed, but to see people fail.  They want to see people run into trees, run over their foot.|Jonathan Lovecchio, noted retard and bane of  his parents.}}

== Internet Culture ==

{{quote|It has to do with [[rap]] [[music]]. That's how [the [[police]]] said it to me.|Sheldon Porochnavy’s [[mother]] after learning of his Ghost Riding [[death]]|<br>one must wonder how much she really loved her son because she gave him the name “Sheldon.”}}

With the rise in popularity of such sites as [[YouTube]], now it is possible for millions of imbeciles and morons to share their Ghost Riding videos with each other. While Ghost Riding is [[illegal]] and participants at Sydeshows can be charged with criminal behavior, these videos seem to crop up on YouTube at an alarming rate. 

Because these videos are popular, owing to the fact that people like to watch other people [[Self Injury|hurt themselves,]] the fad has not contained itself to teenagers.  There are several online accounts of people [[Old|above the age of 50]] Ghost Riding. How they managed to survive until their 50’s is amazing in itself, but to then tempt fate by Ghost Riding at that age, you know you are dealing with some extremely bright bulbs.

Because this hobby is [[Some argue|considered by many]] to be slightly dangerous, YouTube has been pulling many Ghost Riding videos and [[anger]]ing the Ghost Riding community. This is probably the one time YouTube has done something right.

== How To Ghost Ride ==
[[Image:Ghostride25.jpg|thumb|175px|Be sure to wear your ski mask, that way you'll look dope.]]
[[Image:Ghostride15.jpg|thumb|175px|Doing it wrong.]]
[[Image:Ghostride14.jpg|thumb|175px|Doing it right.]]

Since you are reading [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], it is safe to assume that you are one of the following:

: A)&nbsp; A teenage boy
: B)&nbsp; [[Retarded]]
: C)&nbsp; [[Drunk]]/[[:Template:Alcoholic|alcoholic]]
: D)&nbsp; All of the above

Since these [[facts]] have been established, it is also safe to assume that after reading this article you will want to go out and pulverize your mom’s Camry.  By following these steps, it will be possible for you to do these things in short order.

# Obtain a copy of E-40’s single “Tell Me When to Go”
# Find your [[father]]’s car keys
# Wait until your parents are sleeping and then remove the car from the garage
# Slowly push the car out of the driveway so that you do not wake anybody
# Once down the street, start the engine
# Pick up your [[friends]]. Make sure to also pick up that creepy guy who nobody likes but has a fake I.D.
# Go to an alcohol store. Make sure it is the one where that [[Iranian]] guy works because he doesn’t care who he sells beer to
# Find large parking lot or street that is not busy
# Consume as much [[cheap]] [[beer]] as possible
# Be sure to get [[Wikipedia:Hyphy|Hyphy]]
# Start your car and make sure that the E-40 CD is in the car stereo. [[EXTREME|Max volume]] plz
# Put the car in drive and allow it to cruise at idle speed
# Once the car is moving at about 20 miles an hour, it is time to Ghost Ride.  Exit the car via your door and climb on top of it.  You can climb on any surface of the car
# Run your best friend’s foot over
# Scream '''“I’M KING OF THE WORLD!!!”'''
# Bury the car nose-first in a storm ditch or slam it into a grocery cart corral


Once you have mastered these steps, you will be considered a champion car surfer by your friends and a complete dipshit by pretty much everybody else.  One curious side effect of car surfing is that sometimes Ghost Riders (through no skill of their own) will get laid.

==Accidents And Deaths==
[[Image:Ghostride1.jpg|thumb|175px|Sheldon Porochnavy died of Ghost Riding.]]
[[Image:Ghostride12.jpg|thumb|175px|I can't believe 30 chicks actually tried this.]]
[[Image:Ghostride11.jpg|thumb|175px|If you are going to Ghost Ride, don't do it in August.]]
{{squote|Mr. Porochnavy's life came to an abrupt end recently on a stretch of highway outside Saskatoon. On his way home from a night in the city, Mr. Porochnavy fell backward from a moving vehicle, hit his head on the pavement and died later in hospital.|From that dipshit’s blog.}}


Ghost Riding has been the cause of several deaths over the years.  A quick scan on Google will net about 8 reported deaths.  This number is a fabrication as most Ghost Riders are drunk when they are performing their jocular exploits.  This causes police and emergency personnel to attribute the cause of death as “Alcohol Related” because with inflated alcohol related deaths, they get more tax money and stricter laws concerning driving while intoxicated.  Putting “Being a dumbass” down on a death certificate will garner no tax dollars.

==Legality/Awesomeness==

Ghost Riding is extremely illegal, but that doesn’t stop your average dope from taking part in it.  Here is one sad tale of woe and the brilliant follow up that occurred the next day:

{{squote|Hello, My name is Greg. I Live in Lafayette Louisiana. Me and my friends love to ghost ride. So let me go to the story.

So me and my friends after school went to an old vacant parking lot. There was about 40 people and 30 cars. We got in a couple of cars and started to ghost ride around the parking lot. We were there for about 45 min and before we know it there are TV cameras filming us. So we all scatter laughing our asses off. Its all good fun right? Well the Lafayette Police Dept and our school didn’t think so.

Come to find out we are the headline in the news that night and again the next morning. We we get to school the dean of students calls us out of class and has a police officer waiting for us. 5 people got reckless operation tickets and numerous other were suspended! this is crazy all we are doin is trying to have a little fun.

The news described "ghost riding" as putting your car on cruise control at 20 or 30 and getting out of your car and dancing on it. This has blown my mind that it turned into such a big ordeal.|They raise some rocket scientists in Lafayette don’t they?}}

The follow up to Greg’s story is located at the following links:

==Why Ghostriding Is Encouraged==

As Charles Darwin once said, Natural Selection is the process of filtering out indiviual animals from the environment that do not have the necessary traits to survive, leaving only the [[Aryan|best-adapted ones]] to pass on their genes and thus increase the trait's presence, allowing them to survive even better. Sometimes a species' [[Jews|weak ones]] will have certain behavioural traits that will [[Self pwn|actually help those weak individuals die or be killed]], helping that gene to filter ''itself'' out of the gene pool. For example, in human society, the most intelligent ones survive and the stupid ones do not; here, the example of the mutant behavioural trait is [[fucktard|acting moronic]], guaranteeing the individual's death, and helping to filter stupidity out of the gene pool.

There are a certain [[Americunt|subspecies of human]] in which this mutant "fucktard" gene can be found predominantly. The American juvenile, as mentioned above, believes himself to be invulnerable, and will instinctively try anything stupid, ensuring that he will [[An hero|die]]. Thus, the stupid ones will eventually be removed from the American gene-pool. So, car-surfing (one such example of [[fucktard|the trait]]) will kill [[Americunt|him]], helping to remove one more [[fucktard|fucktard]] from their gene pool. 

TL; DR: If [[you]], the reader, happen to be an American teenager, car-surfing is highly encouraged as a form of [[eugenics]], aside from the fact that we all [[haet|hate]] you. For the good of humanity -- and if your [[fat|weight]] doesn't [[disabled|prevent]] you -- [[DO IT FAGGOT|GET ON THE BONNET]].

==How To Win==
[[Image:Ghostride16.jpg|thumb|175px|How many points do you get for being placed under arrest?]]
The object of most games is to [[win]] and Ghost Riding is no different.  Here is a handy guide for grading your Ghost Riding experience that awards or subtracts [[points]] depending on variables that occur while you are Ghosting:

: 11.&nbsp; Being shitfaced = +15 points
: 10.&nbsp; Acrobatics = +10 points
: 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being [[Azn|Asian]] = -10 points
: 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing Nascar jackets = -35 points
: 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being [[Redneck|Nascar fans]] = -95 points
: 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not playing E-40 = -50 points
: 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being [[Asian]] = -75 points
: 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't shake the baby.
: 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not being on the road = -40 points
: 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not ghost riding the whip = -1000 points
: 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; "You ain't ghostriding nigga!" = +2500 points

This point system was found on a Ghost Riding blog and [[White people|we]] at [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] have no fucking idea what most of it means.  We do, however, understand that they don't like [[Azn|Asians]].  LOL THEY SAID IT TWO TIMES!

== Lyrics ==

To help understand this culture, it is probably a wise idea to take a look at the lyrics for two of the most popular Ghost Riding songs.  No, the more that I think about the crappy lyrics, the more I believe that it is not wise to look at them.  It is for that reason that I am putting them in a morph.  Scroll past quickly.
