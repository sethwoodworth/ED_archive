TMI
[[Image:1160626356957.jpg|thumb|Problem solved.]]

TMI stands for "too much information". This phrase, though not used very often, (as [[DO NOT WANT]] is the current Internets standard for extreme displeasure at something)  is typically used when someone admits over the Internets via IM something related to their [[dick]] or [[cunt]] that others would find unpleasant. This also applies when someone admits they view the likes of [[shotacon]] or [[furry]] porn. This abbreviation is thus a [[BAWWW|cry of pain]] over the mental image implanted into the brains of anyone in the conversation. 

==Example==
'''Prima''': Tubgirl makes me feel horny.<br>
'''Secunda''': Okay, TMI.
