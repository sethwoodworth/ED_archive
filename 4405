'''Jonathan King''' is an infamous composer/producer from the 70's who had hits in the [[UK]] with the songs "Una Paloma Blanca," "Everyone's Gone To The Moon," (an incomprehensible song which he later claimed was deliberately a parody of other incomprehensible songs) and "Hooked On A Feeling/I Don't Want To Be [[Gay]]." He was the first person to discover the hamburger and gave it its name.

King is probably more famous for his three [[paedophile|child sex abuse]] charges and subsequent [[jail|incarceration]] in 2001. Although he adamantly proclaims his innocence, he still creates controversy with statements like the "dead man's clause," in which he blamed long dead pop star John [[Lennon]] for his addiction to [[shota|young boys']] smooth [[ass|arses]].

==Online==
During his time in chokey King kept an [[LiveJournal|online journal]] which generated [[drama]] in the form of comments like "Paedophile!", 'burn paedophile!", and "[[fact|'Everyone's Gone To The Moon' is really really shit]]!" aimed at the fallen record producer. His [[insane|hardcore fans]] defended him with comments such as "yes, he may take his love of the kiddies a little too far, but 'Everyone's Gone To The Moon' is a musical masterpiece!" 

==Recent Developments==
Jonathan used his website to [[BAWWW|lay blame on society]] and the fact that if he wanted to go out on the streets and pick up young tail, then he should be allowed to do so without being persecuted. The victims of his crimes set the [[Slander, Slander Salamander]] on to Jonathan after he made statements mocking them, and [[Bill Gates]] immediately [[pwned|shut down]] his website.

==Trolling of b3ta.com==
Jonathan recently posted a video on the message board at [[B3ta]] causing much [[butthurt]] [http://b3ta.com/links/Due_to_unprecedented_demand_from_all_b3ta_users_see_post_below]. He also promoted his new film [http://www.vilepervert.com] as being of [[Unwarranted Self Importance|deep intellectual value and social significance]].
==On Livevideo==
He recently opened up a [[Livevideo]] [http://www.livevideo.com/JonathanKing account] in order to expand his blogging portfolio,show off his acting ability and to troll fucking everything. The community's reaction was tell him to [[GTFO]]; However, Jonathan found an unlikely ally in the form of [[Argent009]][http://www.livevideo.com/video/897CDA9F46784DE1AD900CB6FBACF51E/jonathan-king.aspx?lastvcid=734004].
