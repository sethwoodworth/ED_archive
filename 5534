==2005: Denmark Enrages the Caliphate==

[[Image:Drawmohammed.jpg|thumb|right|Draw Mohammed. [[For great justice|FOR GREAT JUSTICE]].]]
[[Image:Prophetmuhammad.jpg|thumb|right|This is an exact likeness of the prophet Muhammad.]]

[[Last Thursday]], <strike>some [[Danish]] asshole</strike> the King of Denmark decided to post up a bunch of shit Muhammad fanart that found its way into far-right echo chamber ''Jyllands-Posten'', and from there into some influential European newspapers. [[Dubious disclaimer|Ostensibly]], this was motivated by a desire to discover why Western cartoonists were reluctant to draw images of Muhammad in the same way they did [[Raptorjesus|Jesus]]. [[It was a social experiment]], you see. (See gallery)

Needless to say, the entire third world got their knickers in a tangle over a couple of comics that were probably drawn by the guy that does ''Family Circus''. [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Al Sharpton]] aren't the only ones with 'rent-a-riot' flash mobs ready to [[Man the harpoons|spring into action]] with one speed-dial. Hordes upon hordes of screaming [[fanatic]]s sacked and looted [[Hot Topic]]s across the globe, stealing eye-liner, fishnets, and [[Cutting|razor blades]] to use in their [[Satanism|Satan-worshiping]] Muhammadan rituals, trampling one another to death in the process (as usual). Shifty imams even threw in a couple of fake images to make sure their seething meat-brigades were well-seasoned with rage. (See gallery)

From these events, the clever Danes were able to hypothesize that when you print cartoon images of the [[Pedo|prophet]] Muhammad, fundamentalist [[Muslim]]s will get very [[butthurt]] and threaten to behead you and shit. Though [[obvious]] to everyone else, this was apparently a [[Holy shit|novel concept]] to [[liberal]] Scandinavians. They've since [[Troll's remorse|apologized]] for the feature in question, which only pissed off the native-born Danes '''and''' the Muslim immigrants, meaning that Hot Topic franchise-owners had to [[buy a dog]] and get some curtains.

And the next year, exacerbating the [[Oh noes|crisis]], some cheeky [[Fascist|Danish People's Party]] members staged a lighthearted Muhammad-drawing contest and put the videos on [[YouTube]], though they have since been deleted by the Will of [[Satan|Allah]]. (See still images in the gallery)

==2007: [[Facepalm|Yes, This Shit Again]]==
[[Image:BangladeshBlasphemy01.jpg|thumb|75px|right|[[A cat is fine too]] when it comes to offending Muslims.]]

Amazingly, a cartoon need not actually feature a drawing of Muhammad for Muslims to get [[offended]]; simply mentioning his name will suffice to generate mucho [[drama]]. In 2007, a newspaper in [[India|Bangladesh]] printed the cartoon to the right, featuring a conversation between a man and a young boy who is holding a [[cat]]. Translated from [[moonspeak]] their exchange is as follows:

*Man: Boy, what is your name?
*Boy: My name is Babu.

*Man: It is customary to mention Muhammad before the name.

*Man: What is your father's name?
*Boy: Muhammad Abu.

*Man: What's this in your lap?
*Boy: Muhammad Cat.

Yeah, wicked [[Unfunny|funny]], right? The cartoonist's intent seems to have been some mild [[satire]] concerning  the Muslim tendency to name kids 'Muhammad' (though '[[Osama]]' is moar popular at the moment) and not to rag Muhammad himself. Furthermore, the Koran is said to contain many examples of the [[Profit|prophet]]'s love of cats (and [[loli]]). But, [[Islam]] being devoid of [[lulz]] and Muslims in general lacking the [[James Watson|satire gene]], all hell broke out again. The editor was fired, the cartoonist was arrested and the mob demanded his [[Serious business|execution]].

Meanwhile, a Swedish cartoonist and compulsive paraphiliac named Lars Vilks was hatching an ingenious plan. Vilks was a hardcore fetishist, and his fetish was kidnapping and execution by bearded, lice-ridden jihadis. He'd already seen all the [[Mujahideen Video|videos]], watched all the [[Juba the Baghdad Sniper|tapes]], and it finally reached the point where he had to [[Armin Meiwes|act out his sexual needs]] or have a [[Schizophrenia|breakdown]]. So he looked to the august recent history of noble Scandinavia, and figured if some Danish faggots could troll the Ummah into such hysteria, he could one up the bomb-turban guy and finally experience [[Guinea Pig|his personal Nirvana]]. He sat down one September evening, and created... '''MUHAMMAD AS A ROUNDABOUT DOG'''. (See gallery) This was the [[Anontalk.com|most offensive thing a Swede could conceive]], and it succeeded brilliantly. Lars has a $100,000 bounty on his head from some inconsequential bastard stepchild of al-Qa'eda, and was the target of a recent [[Jihad Jane|murder plot]]!! It's only a matter of time before his dream comes true - help him out and make a quick $100,000 on the side by reporting his whereabouts to the Qa'eda-affiliate, ''[http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=15b_1253031466 Islamic State of Iraq''!] There is a 50% bonus if you slice his throat halal lamb style.

Finally, later that year, a [[Britain|British]] schoolteacher was [[v&]] by the [[Sudan]]ese for [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article2971369.ece naming a teddy bear Muhammad.] It's good to know that Sudan has its [[Genocide|priorities straight]]. Many lulz are also had from realizing that the fools [[Irony|inspired far more people to name teddy bears Muhammad than they scared off from doing so]]; see the gallery for multiple delightful examples.

==2010: What is al-Qa'eda Doing Watching ''South Park'', Anyway?==
{{main|Everybody Draw Mohammed Day}}
In April 2010, King of al-Qa'eda and [[Bruno|dirty wizard]] Osama bin Laden finally noticed that ''[[South Park]]'' has not only been depicting Muhammad for years, but doing so in a righteously fucked up fashion, along with every other sacred [[meme]] out there. In response, he has activated his American sleeper cell at [[Revolution Muslim]] and ordered it to declare jihad on ''South Park'', consigning Matt Stone and Trey Parker to a joyous company that also includes [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Geert Wilders]], [[LiveLeak]], [http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806410448590 Eminem,] [[Muslim Massacre|Sigvatr]], Kurt Westergaard (author of the famous bomb-turban image, whom a [[Somalia|Somali]] [[pirate]] tried to kill in 2009), the ecstatic Lars Vilks, and the assassinated [[Netherlands|Theo van Gogh]]. This also means that al-Qa'eda and [[Scientology]] are on the same side. Think about it.


<center><youtube>L_E6zoUJzvU</youtube><br>'''<strike>Viacom got the video removed because they are [[Furry|fags]]</strike> It's back.'''</center>


Then, in May 2010, Lars Vilks attempted to appear publicly to make it easier for Muslims to capture and torture him. He was mildly [[I am disappoint|disappointed]] when all he got was a headbutt...


<center><youtube>nHNQ5A00duI</youtube><br>'''Muslim uses Headbutt! It's [[Pokémon|super effective]]! Lars flinched!'''</center>


...for showing the following video.

If it has been deleted on Jewtube (and it has), go [http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/33434/98ff6c9b/allah_ho_gaybar.html here], to the [[Holland|Promised Land]].


[[Image:FreedomGoToHell.gif|thumb|right|This [[Juggalo|ninja]] is right! [[The Great eBarrier Reef|FUCK FREEDOM!!]]]]

Finally, in response to the fatwa on Stone and Parker, a Seattle cartoonist named Molly Norris declared May 20, 2010 "[[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day|Everybody Draw Muhammad Day]]," which was certain to create many lulz in the form either of butthurt Muslims waving such incisive and inspiring protest signs as seen to the right, or [[Liberalism|cultural imperialists]] trying to foist [[free speech]] on an unwilling Ummah and getting their [[Terrorism|just comeuppance]]. It did not [[disappoint]], and so the ages-old war between Islam and its main antagonist, [[anime|cartoons]], continues to bore the rest of the planet, which just wants to get back to killing Jews.

However, soon after issuing her clarion call, [http://mollynorris.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/117/ Molly Norris] [http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html caved] (linked pages deleted as Norris [[Flounce|withdraws]] from the internets in mortal fear) to [[offended]] Muslims' threats to saw off her head with a hunting knife and post pics, Daniel Pearl-style. Apparently, since it wasn't just Osama and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|Mahmoud]] getting pissed off, but also [[Oxymoron|moderate Muslims]], at the idea of a bunch of wacky kuffar getting together to exercise their rights of [[Trolling|free expression]], she adopted the opinion that [[Internet|we]] should scrap the whole idea to spare their delicate feelings. On the contrary, the fact that anyone should need to tiptoe around the retarded sacred [[Lolcow|cow]]s of a bunch of uptight fanatical [[Kimmo Alm|control freak]]s, or that they should feel bound by threat of violence, or service to a Chamberlainesque ideal of tolerance, to follow the strictures of a religion ''they don't even practice'', should be a wake-up call to any thinking, observant person of creeping [[Saudi Arabia|Shari'a]] abetted by clueless orientalist liberals. Don't let her mealy-mouthed, relativist cowardice dissuade [[you]]; [[DO IT FAGGOT|FUCKING DRAW MUHAMMAD]], and [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Muhammad_Cartoons&action=edit post the results] here!!
