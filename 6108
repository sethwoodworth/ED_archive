'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Oversight Oversight]''', now known as "[[cocksucking|revision hiding]]", is a process that is used in [[Wikipedia]] to be, in their own words, "a form of [[extreme]] [[deletion]], intended for privacy, [[BLP|defamation]] and (at times) [[copyright]]ed information which are to be [[raped|expunged]] from any form of usual access". It even removes info so that the Wikipedo admins cannot even see it, [[lol]], because TOW doesn't trust its own [[sysop]]s, unlike [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], where there is no such thing as oversight, only normal deletion, meaning that ED Sysops [[crystal ball|can see everything]] that has ever been entered into the [[wiki]] including [[dox]].

Very few people on Wikipedia actually have the power to oversight revisions. This makes it a huge effort whenever oversight truly is necessary, because the normal [[Wikipedo]]s have got to [[fellatio|grovel]] at the feet of those above them just to remove a bit of [[epic]] [[trolling]]. This makes oversight a very easy process to gain [[lulz]] from if you know how to play them at their [[The Game|own game]].

Like most things on Wikipedia, oversight is commonly abused. Theoretically, oversighters have to follow [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Oversight#Policy|these rules]], but in practice, they can do whatever the fuck they want because only they can see the revisions they hid, so nobody else can challenge them. If you complain about oversight abuse, your complaint also gets oversighted, as can be seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&page=User_talk:Pieceenter here].

==How to Invoke Oversight==
[[Image:Jake Grawp.png|thumb|Oversight hid the comment, but the page move was still visible.]]
===The Dumb Way===
Say you're going to carry out a [[school shooting]] or [[terrorist]] attack. Assuming you're not using [[Tor]], the Wikipedos will identify you by your [[IP]] address and the [[party van]] will show up outside your door within five minutes (further information on this topic can be found [[TOV|here]]).

===The Smart Way===
:1. Go onto [[4chan]]'s /[[b]]/ (4chan is by far the most [[desirable|preferable]] [[imageboard]] for this for a number of reasons. No [[banhammer]] for it, lots of [[newfags]], and lots of [[personal army|people willing to do what you tell them]].)
:2. Make up some fake personal info. For example, "[[chav|Lisa from Manchester UK]] gives [[swingers|great head]]; please call her on (+44) 07768 912385" (make sure it is a fake number like that one - the Wikipedos will still [[BAWWWWW|get upset]] about it though).
:3. Spam every thread with a request to edit a Wikipedia page, preferably one with a long edit history, and replace it with this content.
:4. Create a [[tinyurl]] with the libelous revision of the Wikipedia page that the first newfag edited because you told him to, on editing mode, then tell people to go to that tinyurl and click "Save page" ([[Grawp]] does this.)
:5. Keep spamming that tinyurl save page [[bullshit]].
:6. Watch the page get protected and oversighted by [[butthurt]] [[Wikipedophiles]] getting worked up in a [[menopause|hot flush]], especially if their username is [[Alison]]. Also, be sure to make your target page has many, many revisions in the edit history as [[MediaWiki]] makes it take [[at least 100 years|much more time]] for sysops to restore all the revisions of a page with hundreds of revisions compared to a page with very few, because every revision has to be ticked individually in a checkbox for it to be restored. Large pages when deleted and restored can also cause the database to lockdown resulting in the [[Administrators' noticeboard]] being flooded with complaints as soon as editing comes back online.
:7. [[????]]
:8. [[PROFIT]]

It is often [[best]] if you make your tinyurl links in the numbered "???? PROFIT" style to make them more appealing to [[chan]]ners, to deceive them into thinking there is a [[delicious cake|reward]] at the end, whereas actually you're just making [[tool]]s of them, [[lawl]].
