It all started with [[Polish Lollercaust|the greatest tragedy in Poland's history]]...

Then, not a long time later, some local [[newfags|Scouts]] decided it would be fun to [[troll|honour]] this event. They placed a big, wooden and shitty [[Cross-post|cross]] right in front of Presidental Palace in Warsaw ([[Shit nobody cares about|the capital of Poland]]), accidentally starting one of the greatest, [[fail|epic meme]] that [[Polandball]] have ever seen in it's history.  

After traditional [[BAWWW|national mourning]], newly elected head of the country, President [[Admin|Bronislaw Komorowski]], stated that he wants to get rid of the wooden [[buttsex|pain in the ass]], standing in the frontyard of his [[4chan|workplace]]. This would've been acceptable on the Moon - but not in Poland. Right after the President published his statement, a group of [[oldfags|old people]] got very, very seriously [[Rage|raegd]] and declared they would defend the cross even at the cost of their own lives. At first, nobody gave a damn, but the determination of these codgers quickly received media attention, because it was a slow news day, and nothing interesting happens in Poland. Ever since, and this means literally a couple of months, [[Btards|old people, fanatics and radical right-winged politicians]], calling themselves [[Lol wut| The Defenders of the Cross]] are standing under the cross, ranting, dancing and threatening everyone who attempts to take the cross away - [[Fail| that includes government, police or military, and even catholic priests]] - additionally causing [[facepalm|epidemy of facepalm]] in a more civilized part of the nation. 

==Right or wrong??==

[[Some argue]] that the incident is somehow actually useful for every side of the conflict, and that is:

* Government - doing nothing, paralyzed by fear of their popularity amongst 90%-[[idiot|catholic]]-society. It's highly doubtful that anyone here would do something after all, so everyone sits back and enjoys the [[lulz]]. 

* Political opposition force - support the Defenders and barking on the ministers, as it usually goes in [[Democracy|demorcacy]]. The [[Lol|funniest]] part is, that the main opposing politician who maintains the [[Meaningless noise|earfuck]] around the case is [[Clone|Jaroslaw Kaczynski]], brother of "4/10 President" [[Polish Lollercaust|Lech Kaczynski]].

* Priests - "This is not our case, it doesn't include us". Actual quote. [[Facepalm]].

* Old people - [[Lie|at last, someone can hear about them and really cares for what they are doing.]] 

* Rest of the country - [[What?|What is this I don't even]]

==Connections with catholic church==

Priests of catholic church in Poland officially cut the problem loose. What was not easy for them to do for abortion, euthanasia or [[BDSM]], was an piece of [[cake|Cake]] when it came to crosses and old loons. The Vatican hasn't spoken about the case because they're too busy chasing choirboys around the pulpit.

==Grenades and shit in a jar==

[[Image:Tablica1.jpg|thumb|right|Shitty memorial.]]
[[At least 100 years ago|A couple of days ago]] the cross was screened off with heavy concrete barriers and a deflector shield. This was the beginning of The Ultimate Cage Match between teh Holy Warriors and their foes - needless to say, lulz ensued: one of the senile and "peaceful" men brought an unarmed hand grenade with him and threated to kill everyone if the cross didn't stay in it's place; sadly, before he made an attempt to become [[an hero]], the police took away his impotent prop and made him BAWWWW. Then 
[[A challenger appears|a challenger appeared]] with another [[Zalgo|Old One]], and [[1guy1jar|armed with something more dangerous than a grenade]]. Somehow he managed to avoid the security goons and made it all the way to the memorial plaque, placed on the walls of Presidential Palace to honor teh 4/10 catastrophe victims, and smashed a jar full of his own shit right on the memorial.

The second guy actually managed to become something close to an hero: his invention - an alternative to the famous Molotov's Cocktail - was officially called "Kaczynski's Cokctail," referring either to the dead ex-president or to his brother, an idol of Cross Corps, who can throw his own shit at everyone he doesn't like in an even better way than our fuck-headed hero.
