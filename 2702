'''Erik Bloodaxe''' (aka Chris Goggans, aka Nark) was a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] hacking group and the editor of Phrack Magazine for issues 42 to 48.  As a youthful hacker, some say Erik appeared to look [[retarded]]  (left).  Today he looks somewhat different (see right).  When confronted with these images, Erik Bloodaxe was quoted as saying:

''"Seeing those two pictures up is really depressing me.  I like Biscuits and Mustard."''

Although remembered as a hacker, Erik was also an informant during the FBI investigation of Legion of Doom and Phrack as part of [[Operation Sundevil]] in 1988-1990.  His actions at this time resulted in [[2600]] and Phrack co-founder Craig Neidorf being faced with 31yrs imprisonment for publishing a technical document on the U.S. 911 telephony system.

Erik Bloodaxe then wrestled Phrack Magazine away from its original editors in a bloodthirsty and drunken coup, which saw his reign over the e-zine between the years of 1993 and 1996.  These days, Erik Bloodaxe works as a government "Security Advisor", and makes frequent trips to [[Japan]] where he is rumoured to solicit [[sex]] from underage male prostitutes.

Surprisingly enough Goggans was not the first person to adopt the name ''Erik Bloodaxe''.  The name also refers to the last Anglo-Saxon king of York.  But after being exiled, that particular Erik was killed by his own murderous Northumbrian peasants around 954AD.  One can only hope the same fate awaits Goggans.
