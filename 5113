[[Image:Porsche 911 crash 9.jpg|thumb|[[Nikki Catsouras|Does it]] look like [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] [[nobody cares|gives a fuck]] about your stupid, [[retarded|dumb]] dead [[bitch]]? Go back to your [[hugbox]], Madman C, you stupid [[faggot]].]]
'''Madman C''' is a [[butthurt]] [[faggot]] who can't stop [[BAWWWWW|bawwwwwing]] about the fact that some girl he once knew and couldn't have [[secks]] with despite his massive efforts called [[whore|Liza Phillips]], a [[16-year-old girl|20-year-old girl]], died in a car crash in [[2006]]. Liza Phillips was also [[pregnant]] like any typical [[whore]] of her age at the time of [[lulz|her death]]. As of 2008, the butthurt continues, and Madman C [[aspierations|takes out his frustration]] on [[Wikipedia]]. There is a [[lulz|long term abuse]] page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long_term_abuse/Madman_C dedicated to Madman C] on [[TOW]], which has a moderate level of lulz, but nothing approaching [[epic lulz]]. According to [[Wikipedo]]s, he has a particular [[predilect]] for the [[Wikipedia Sandbox]].

[[winrar|Greg Parker]], who was also in the vehicle at the time, is his target of [[hate]]. Madman C regularly wishes that Greg Parker was one of the people who had died instead of Liza Phillips. Indeed, he is [[batshit crazy|obsessed]] with making [[threats of violence]] against the people who were driving the vehicle in which she crashed. This can be seen in his stupid [[article]]s that he tries to create such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_I_wish_were_dead this] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_should_have_died_instead_of_Liza_Phillips this], which were [[pwnt]] by the [[criteria for speedy deletion]]. Even [[NawlinWiki]] agrees with Encyclopedia Dramatica on this one!

Madman C says that we should [[never forget]] Liza Phillips' death, which was reported in the [[old media]] [[at least 100 years ago|some time ago]], and tries [[epic fail|in vain]] to make sure the rest of the world remembers this. Indeed, Madman C tried to come to Encyclopedia Dramatica to seek help and find a [[personal army]] to create [[kosovo|worldwide recognition]] of Liza Phillips and how [[nobody cares|unjustified]] her death was. However, since Madman C is a [[retard]], he didn't realise that [[ED|the enemy]] of [[TOW|your enemy]] is not necessarily your friend, and made a big mistake in trying to get ED to [[USI|ask for support on this issue]]. Madman C should have learned that ED only recognises [[lulz]]y [[vandal]]s, such as [[LULZofOLDE]]. Liza Phillips' remains are smacked by LULZofOLDES [[massive cock]] every day, [[for the lulz]].

His number of [[sockpuppet]]s is pathetic in comparison with the number accumulated by LULZofOLDE and [[MascotGuy]]. Seriously, someone should [[VFD|MFD]] his long term abuse page for the lulz, 'cause it's a lot less funny than that of Mmbabies. Whilst we're at it, LULZofOLDE really needs his own long term abuse subpage - go on, [[Alison]], create it, because we know you have both nightmares and erotic dreams about LULZofOLDE, and you can't stop thinking about him whilst you're at [[work]] for [[Apple]] Inc., who don't have offices in [[Ireland]], hence you being Irish-American. Hell, you've admitted all of this on the [[Wikipedia Review]]. 

==Typical Madman C [[BAWWWWW]]WWWWWWW quote==
{{quote|Greg Parker [[some argue|should have died]] instead of Liza Phillips. Liza was a [[mundane|very good person]] and one of my [[BFF|best friends]]. Most of my [[shit nobody cares about|happiest childhood memories]] revolve around her. [[lie|She never did anything wrong in her entire life]]. Greg, on the other hand, is a complete [[pretty cool guy|deadbeat]]. He is a pathetic lowlife who is currently in [[jail]] for selling [[drugs|coccaine]] to [[teenager]]s. I never thought it would be possible for me to completley hate another human being as much as I hate him. [[butthurt|He is the one who should have had his head crushed under that truck]].}}
