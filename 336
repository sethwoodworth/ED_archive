'''Alex Ford''', also known as '''Chevex''' on the Interwebs, is a super-successful bachelor/entrepreneur who literally [[bel air|turned his sad life upside down]]. After finding the website [[so ronery|SuccessfulBachelor.com]] was available, he snapped it up, [[fatty|lost weight]], became [[rich and beautiful|fabulously wealthy and now enjoys life every day]]. Alex is living [[so cash|so large]] he only works four hours a week and spends the rest of his time playing [[online poker]] and [[Halo]]. Alex also owns the website [[U413.com]], a powerful uber [[1337]] [[h4x0r]]ing community. Here he tries to worm money out of his members with quick money-making schemes.

Alex believes he is a [[asspie|1337]] [[fucktard|h4x0r]], although still [[:File:Alexcantirc.PNG|doesn't know how to use IRC]] and still uses [[MySpace]] and [[Twitter]] to chat to people. He has also no idea of the concept that [[don't feed the trolls|one should not feed the trolls]]. Alex is also a web designer, using Times New Roman as his font of choice. Secretly he forgot the HTML code for font styles. Due to his controlled efforts towards being a [[Basement dweller|totally skilled hacker]], Alex <s>still lives with his parents</s> recently purchased a beach house on a pristine [[Utah]] oceanfront with all the money he's made [[circle jerk|networking bachelors]].

Alex is most famous for declaring war on [[Lmte]] for his efforts at reverting the edits to his website's [[ED]] article, and after failing miserably went and contacted his [[Lawyer]] in an attempt to get his already publicly available personal information off the site. He then went on to [[Oh noes|sue ED]].

Oh, and he [[Irony|hates E-penis]].

==Alex on LUELinks==
[[Image:Unh4nd13d USI.png|thumb|center|1000px|Chevex, getting told to [[stfu]] as usual]]

{{quote|NO NUMBERS!!!|Chevex}}

Alex used to hang on another uber secret forum known as [[LUELinks]]. Alex got promptly banned after trying to bring everyone into his shitty schemes. Soon after, Alex rebuilt [[U413]] and added in features that he stole from LUELinks. Soon after, both sites became rivals with each other because Alex refused to [[shut the fuck up]] after being told time and time again to [[get the fuck out]]. There are never any wars between the two sites because they are both pretty much locked up.

LUELinks is responsible for Alex's E-penis phobia, since their forum has numbers and his does not. Except of course, for [[Pi]].

==Alex's lolsuit==
{{main|U413}}
[[Image:U413sclosed.png|thumb|right|[[Pools Closed|U413's Closed]]]]

Alex found U413's ED article thanks to [[Google]] Alerts, since he has it set to notify him on his internet handle. He flipped when he saw it, creating a sticky on his forum asking for his members to come to ED and vandalize the article because his personal information was left there. His members immediately joined him and started defacing the page, soon resulting in the article being locked. In his epic fit of [[butthurt]], he went and told his members to flame [[Lmte]]'s talk page instead.

<center>{{Morphquote|everyonelovesed|background-color: white;|font-weight: bold;
|Looks like the war has begun between U413 and ED user lmte|Chevex, declaring war against [[Lmte]] for reverting his vandalism
|Now we should all go to lmte's user page and insult him...........many times and in many ways.|Chevex
|The lock expires May 19th. We'll just have to keep this up and rally everyone to rape it again on that day.|Chevex
|}}</center>

Soon after, Alex went batshit paranoid, realising he had a [[psyops|mole]] on his forum and his IRC. After realising vandalising your own ED article never works (especially when you use your Internet handle as your ED username), Alex was told by various people that he could have had an [[Arbchat]] to get his [[dox]] removed. Alex decided it wasn't worth the hassle, so he called his [[Lawyer]] to get it done for him, but this proved useless.

{{quote|I'll be polite until they moment they try to accuse me of ANYTHING|Chevex not knowing how court works.}}

After being laughed at by his lawyers, Alex soon backed down, deciding not to attack ED because it just wasn't "worth the hassle".

==I DON'T CARE ABOUT ED!111==
[[image:I_STILL_DONT_CARE_ABOUT_ED.png|thumb|left|I DON'T CARE]]
[[image:I_STOPPED_CARING_ABOUT_ED.png|thumb|right|I REALLY DON'T CARE]]
Following his previous escapade of failing to sue ED, Alex stated he "didn't care about ED or /b/" yet continued lurking both of them like a [[newfag]]. He then started contributing to this article as well as the article on [[U413]], also trying to conceal his dox by saying he moved to an "undisclosed location" but also <s>using find and replace on his old username</s> [[fucktard|looking through every word in the article]] to change ''Unh4nd13d'' to ''Chevex'' when he could have just copied it all into [[Notepad]] and pressed Ctrl+H.

The pic Alex likes to distribute is fully following the instructions of a [[fat girl angle shot]]. In these videos however, you can see how much of a [[fat]] fuck he really is.
