'''[http://boards.4chan.org/3/ /3/]''' is a relatively new board added to [[4chan]] [[last Thursday]], named as such for the fact that it only gets an average of 3 posts a day.  While it's unknown why [[moot]] added it in the first place, it is now a haven for professional 3d modeller wannabe's, newfags redirected from a thread on /b/ and the occasional [[Troll|newbie]] popping in asking how he can get started. The twelve or so people on /3/ refer to themselves as t/3/apots ('''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot explanation]''').

==Typical goings on==

/3/ is [[retarded|slow]]; I mean really [[derp|slow]].  While you have to constantly refresh a thread on /b/, [[fail|anything posted to /3/]] will be on page 1 for at least the next 24 hours. With that said, /3/ is easy incredibly easy to flood. In fact, [[you]] could probably go there and flood the board by yourself. Before moot put in a [[captcha]], the entire front page was filled with [[diochan]] spam. Such a catastrophe led many other boards, such as /k/, /co/, and /a/, to help the poor, defenseless t/3/abaggers fight the spambots. Even /b/ came to the party, but no one wanted to play with them because they break everything they touch.

Posting combos and guessing post numbers on /3/ is tantamount to saying "I'm a newfag, please rape my face." Combos are nothing special on /3/, but if you fail to achieve a combo, you should [[Suicide|kill yourself]] immediately as there is no excuse for failing a combo on the slowest board on 4chan.

==Giga Exodus==
On December 1st, 2010, /b/tards seeking a new home invaded /3/, after using up all of /x/ and causing all but page 0 to disappear.
