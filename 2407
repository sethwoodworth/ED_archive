This is about the side effects and bonuses that come from being a werejohncandy.

Here are some things you should know.. 

{{frame|Werejohncandyism is not only for guys, girls can play too. That's why we added Cassie to our colourful cast of characters, to be a female counterpart/love interest to

Chumsley so he wouldn't be sad and lonely anymore.

Werejohncandies are in no way scary or fierce.

Contrary to what that article on slapstick anarchy says, i do not turn into JC himself when a crispy kreme donuts ad comes on the tv screen - the only occassions i have ever turned into him are during the luna eclipse and if i'm watched just one too many of his movies which is actually quite normal.

There is no way on earth that i'd do anything to make a mockery out of John Candy - he is/was the greatest comic who ever lived - and i respect him for that. He could do serious as well as funny. Not many actors can do that without faling victim to Tom Hanks Syndrome you know - which is named after Tom Hanks. Although Jim Carrey has somehow survived from it.

I'm against all jokes that are directed towards Michael Jackson and done in bad taste or are just insensitive }}
