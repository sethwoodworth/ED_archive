Snitch
''If you are looking for the ED sysop Snitch, click [[User:Snitch|here]], and no connection to [[User:Tehsnitch]]'' 

Conceived as a bastard offspring from the copulation of a New Jersey [[jews|Jewess]] and a Sam's Club 40 gallon vat of crisco, many followers of Kaballah consider snitch to be a [[Fat]] Golem. Due to his unfortunate genetics and high trans-fat content he has been banned from being served in restaurants in New York City.
== A portrait of failed lulz ==
[[Image:Snitchportrait.jpg|thumb|right|please feed me I'm fucking starving]]
snitch is an [[troll|internet troll]] who fails to understand that [[lulz]] require that you actually be [[funny]]. To compound his affliction of [[fag]]gotry he also carries the title of Worlds Most Sensitive Troll. All one has to do to get him lividly angry is say something about his [[Your_mom|mom]], his rampant [[drugs|drug]] use, or mention that he's been convicted of a violent crime. It is clear to see that when one cannot handle the lulz of others it is a poor choice to engage in counter lullification.

snitch has gone by the handles cpio and stamina on the internet before, the googling of which reveals his rich history of [[DDOS|packetting]] people on the [[internet]]s. snitch is one of the few people who actually understands how [[The_Internet_is_serious_business|serious the internet is]]. This is a man who is highly clever and fearsome in the same way that [[Armenians]] don't stink like shit. To prove his unflinching immunity to criticism he will probably claim that this article is [[Defamation|defamation]].

== The great snitch [[Ruin|self-ruin]] of '07 ==

In March of '07 snitch became enraged in an [[irc]] chatroom because militant pointed out that he's a drug addict criminal. He then proceeded to [[stalk]] one of the main ops in that channel, Dead-Bum, because apparently other people criticizing him is serious fucking business. Shortly thereafter snitch went around to multiple [[irc]] networks and channels and dropped Dead-Bum's [[Docs|docs]]. This is surely a terrible fate for Dead-Bum except that he's not a [[16-year-old_girl|16 year old girl]]. Perhaps because snitch still lives with his [[Your_mom|mom]] he thinks that this is maxruin. 

snitch would probably have gotten away with his doc dropping non troll without counter lullification by Dead-Bum, however he made a critical mistake, likely brought about by his severe mental [[Retard|retardation]]. You see, after all this [[drama]] snitch continued to use a link on Dead-Bum's webserver that linked to [[Last_measure|last measure]]. This move is the prototypical snitch troll; 

* Go into channel

* wait for people to ask for picture

* post URL to snitch.png

* link actually redirects to [[Last_measure|last measure]]

* lulz, rinse, repeat

Dead-Bum noticed that snitch.png was continuing to show up in his webserver logs, meaning snitch was continuing to post it for mediocre irc [[lulz]], even though he had no control over where the link would point. Dead-Bum decided to have some fun with all this. Since snitch has the internet popularity of a [[Heterosexual|heterosexual]] at a [[Linux]] User Group it was not difficult to dig up pictures, and personal details about him from the plethora of his past enemies. All of this delightful information was photochopped into a humorous picture of him featuring his [[Breasts|man breasts]], and then snitch.png was changed from [[Last_measure|last measure]] to redirect to the new picture, featured here. (Actual picture was not blurred out in critical areas)

What makes this self-ruin so insidious, is that he continued to post this link over and over again for weeks, never clicking it himself because he assumed it was still [[Last_measure|last measure]] and he did not want to be [[Owned|owned]]. We can imagine the conversations went something like this:
<pre>
<fagglerock> snitch: you talk so much shit about how $person looks, let's see your pic.
<snitch> ok, hold pls.
<snitch> http://Dead-BumsServer.com/snitch.png
<fagglerock> wtf
<fagglerock> why would you post that?
<snitch> LOL U CLICKED
<snitch> pwned
<fagglerock> you're a dumbass.
<snitch> haha no u
</pre>
and thus it went for weeks with snitch totally oblivious to his self-ruin and Dead-Bum achieving maxlols without having to lift a finger. The best trolls are the ones that others do for you. The moral of this story is: Man who live in glass house should stop eating so much fucking gravy.
