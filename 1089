Bomani Armah
[[Image:ReadABookNigga.jpg|thumb|Read a book, nigga.]]

'''Bomani Armah''' is a coconut black person who is white on the inside and therefore thinks straight, almost like a sensible [[racist|white person]] and hates black persons with all the fervor of a [[klan]]sman. In the following video, he reminds all the other niggas to read a motherfuckin' [[Mein_Kampf|book]], raise their goddamn kids, drink some fucking water, buy some [[Africa|land]], fuck spinning rims, brush their goddamn teeth, and wear [[Riding_Dirty|deodorant]].
