One of the most information-theorically redundant, trite, overused verbal phrases on Wikipedia. Among all overused phrases, in the same league as ''[[citation needed]]'' and ''[[some argue]]''. Includes variants with modal verbs and inserted adverbs. Especially annoying because the writer is such a fucking, [[faggot|effeminate homo]] that he doesn't have the balls to address the reader directly with the second-person singular-number personal pronoun instead of the impersonal infinitive form of the [[sex|copulative]] verb ''to be'', and because the writer preaches to the reader like a supposed [[Internet tough guy]].

:Example: ''[Novodevichy Convent] should not be confused with the Novodevichy Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.''
