<b>DynaCatlovesme</b> is an ancient hippy douchebag and registered sex offender who's bent on making [[pedophilia]] as mainstream and socially acceptable as [[faggotry]]. Next to [[Logan Sperman]], Dyna is [[Irish282]]'s and [[Updownmostly]]'s [[BFF]] on YouTube. Dyna has recently joined the [[Young Tubers United|Jesari Crusade]], and has become a very vocal critic of anyone who doesn't think that [[13 year old boy|12 year olds]] should be allowed unsupervised on YouTube. In fact, recently Dynacat joined [[Updownmostly]] to form Jimothy, a vile being that can molest all boys in a [[Over 9000|300 mile]] radius at will. Their romantic meetings can be viewed on Dynacats channel, they are expecting a [[Buttsechs|buttbaby]].

As of July 22, 2010, the whereabouts of <b>DynaCatlovesme</b>, aka <b>James Henry</b> are unknown.  Many speculate that Jim may have suffered a [[an hero|fatal overdose]] after his early morning battle with apricot brandy, [[YouTube]], and his usual cocktail of psychiatric medications.  Whether the [[YouTube_Vigilantes|YouTube Vigilantes]] and [[Circarigel]] intervened, and called the internet police is unknown.

==Compassionate apathy==
Dyna has taken it upon himself to play [[anti-troll]] in the battle for [[YouTube]]. He suggests that suspected pedophiles should be allowed to continue doing what they're doing, so that [[bullshit|they can be apprehended by the police]] [[IRL]]. While this sounds well and good on the surface, [http://www.youtube.com/profile_subscriptions?user=DynaCatlovesme&page=1 one look at his subscriptions] will tell you that this is a ruse, and he is in [[fact]] a [[NAMBLA]] supporter. Amid the cornocopia of subscriptions to little boys can be found a subscription to [[dendrophilian]], who has stated in no uncertain terms that it's absolutely copacetic to [[rape]] children.

==DynaCat explains his affinity for the kiddies==

[[Image:DynaFag.JPG|thumb|"I'm a little teapot short and stout..."]]
[[Image:Dynafaggotfuck.jpg|thumb|This explains everything.]]
In a lulzy 7-part series of [[TL;DW]] videos, DynaCat gives very [[bullshit|logical and rational explanations]] for his excessive subscriptions to [[13 year old boy]]s, along with his thoughts on what "real pedophiles" are.

*<strike>{{youtube|vaFrqe47jjU|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 1)}}</strike> - deleted
**Dyna had heard the buzz about YouTube, and started checking it out. He stumbled across [[Galipoka]], and found himself uncontrollably compelled to subscribe to him since his name was so similar to "Galipoli". Dyna searched and searched, but just couldn't find any good videos by adults! Not only that, but strangely enough, he couldn't find any good videos by little girls either! They all had shitty video cameras, and only talked about "girly things". Placed in such a precarious position, DynaCat was forced to subscribe to a myriad of "very talented" little boys with good quality video cameras.

**Dyna stumbles across [[Ytask]], and claims that he immediately knew [[O RLY?|something was afoot]]. His biggest clue: lots of subscriptions to little boys. 


*<strike>{{youtube|5Y6whPwhVEc|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 3)}}</strike> - deleted
**In this episode, DynaCat talks about a user named "Splitpersonalityboy", who was a pedophile that was trying to disguise himself as a child. Dyna fails to mention why he's currently subscribed to a channel that's [http://www.youtube.com/user/TidewaterHippie1969 doing the exact same fucking thing].


*<strike>{{youtube|WpOtF8Iwnzg|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 4)}}</strike> - deleted
**In this video, Dyna chronicles the events just prior to the banning of [[Young Tubers United|Jesari]]. He recalls this to be the first time he ever heard that [[Irish282]] was a pedophile, with the caveat that [http://www.google.com/search?q=Irish282&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls= he couldn't find any evidence to support that assertion].


*<strike>{{youtube|90LgSqgjOMk|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 5)}}</strike> - deleted
**Dyna talks about the "haters". He's convinced that they're all from "the [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]".


*<strike>{{youtube|Xim_ZKPHeTc|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 6)}}</strike> - deleted
**Here Dyna pulls an incredible theory straight out of his ass. Holmes has deduced, by way of his learningz, that the [[YouTube Yahweh Clan]] is, in fact, a faction of The Sons of Yahweh neo-nazi church. The [[evidence]] presented is irrefutable: that they both have the word "[[Yahweh]]" in their names.


*<strike>{{youtube|uGXRfWZh7Go|Youtube, Kids, Predators and Me - A Series (Part 7)}}</strike> - deleted
**Dyna, still pulling theories out of his rectum, says that the chances of a kid getting molested online are [[lolwut|about 0%]]. While he's able to sniff out a belly-dancing 12 year old boy from 1000 miles away, googling up the [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=rxq&q=percentage+of+children+molested+by+online+strangers&btnG=Search actual figure of 12-24%] was just too fucking difficult. His final words of wisdom were on the topic of fixing the "hate" situation on YouTube. The Dyna-solution: when someone gets banned, they should stay banned. That's brilliant. I guess he missed the memo about the whole "Restore Jesari" crusade, essentially an attempt to get him and Galipoli <i><b>unbanned</b></i>.

==Trolling DynaCatlovesme==

[[Image:Dyna Confesses.JPG|thumb|Jim confesses to looking at [[cp]]!!1]]
[[Image:Iurhqeihegioehi.jpg|thumb|Dynacats dad on [[chatroulette]], even he is [[son|dissapoint]].]]
When [[trolling]] Dyna, one should always make it absolutely clear that they are indeed a [[nazi]]. Dyna has a deep-seated love/hate obsession for nazi's, and always sends out [[lulzy]] dramatic bulletins whenever he feels he has found one. Dyna has stated on several occasions that his arch-nemesis the [[YouTube Yahweh Clan]] are a neo-nazi group, despite the fact that one of its most prominent members is, in [[fact]], a [[Yahweh|black woman]].

{{quote|I consider the slaughter of over 6 million innocent people equally as enraging a company's choice to suspend children from their website. Great video.|yankeaze|[[sarcasm]] [[ninja]]}}

{{quote|Do you have any Jewish friends? I'm sure they would appreciate you making such an utterly crass comparison.

Have you no shame?|TonyWyoming|on what an [[cock|insensitive fuck]] DynaCat is}}

{{quote|My final comment. Your video does show persecution
of Jews and other minorities, and does equate it with suspension of kids on YouTube. I think that's an inappropriate comparison. It's Godwin's Law in full flight. Frankly, I would have expected better judgment from a historian!|richieprep|having to explain the obvious to DynaCat}}

==Dyna threatens a [[Lawlsuit]]==
[[Image:Dyna_lawyer_letter_p1.jpg|thumb| Good luck Dyna.]]
[[Image:Dyna_pajamas.jpg|thumb|lawlsuits or a sewing kit?  we know which one jim picked.]]
When [[Troy Riser]] included Dyna in his list of YouTube pedophiles, he was furious. He contacted attorney [[Lilo|Robert Levin]], and had him draft up a very dramatic "cease and desist" letter. The jury is still out on what's lulzier, Dyna believing that he can sue people for their opinions, or that he was actually able to find some two-bit ambulance chaser that was willing to initiate court documents under the title of "YouTube User: DynaCatlovesme VS Troy Riser".

==Can you say "obsession"?==
Since getting [[troll]]ed by the [[YouTube Yahweh Clan]] Dyna has been completely obsessed with bringing about their demise. He's decided that the best way to do this is to make video after video about the history of the Clan. Each video is lovingly crafted in the traditional DynaCatlovesme [[tl;dw]] style. Here is the current round of samplings available on his channel:

==Dyna responds to his [[ED]] article==
{{quote|The [[YTYC|Yahweh Clan]] and [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] supress free speach, not I. Do I have any ability to rebut the fantasy that is posted on ED about me? I do not. Anyone who even slightly opposes you in any way is terrorized with the sole objective of shutting them up. I am the perfect example. For making ONE COMMENT challenging 'Roo's logic, I have been terrorized, threatened, and vilified for six months. DO NOT try to say you support free speach!|DynaCatlovesme needs a [[whambulance|whaaaaambulance]]}}
{{quote|Absolutely harmless? Are you drunk? I have a friggin' ED page that say I'm in a friggin' SOR! That isn't harmful? How would you like it? How hard have you tried to get my real address and full name? You commited [[lolwut|felonies]] to that end. I was forced to pay [[stupid|thousands of dollars of hard-gained money]] to prevent it! Sorry, that is hardly harmless. And [[NO U|you WILL pay for it]].|DynaCatlovesme threatens [[moar]] [[lawlsuit]]s}}
{{quote|You have no right to harass people and invade their privacy and surpress their freedom of speech. Why you believe its funny to do those things is beyond the comprehension of anyone sane. ED is only pathetic and sick. Parody and satire are legally limited to PUBLIC FIGURES eg. politicians, celebrities. Having a YouTube account does not make someone "fair game."|DynaCatlovesme, on how to fail Law School}}

==DynaCatlovesme vs. Pigslop==
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. In a bizarre turn of events deposed YouTube method actor [[Pigslop]] has returned, and come out swinging at none other than DynaCatlovesme. Piggy had heard that Dyna was mentioning him in his 29-part mini-series on the [[YTYC]], and decided to take Mr. Psuedo-intellectual to task for it. You're watching these lulz in realtime.

== Fourth Of July Getaway With [[UpDownMostly]] ==
[[Image:Dyna_wins_a_hat.jpg|thumb|Jim won this hat.]]
[[Last Thursday]], Dyna and UpDownMostly (Tim) decided it would be great fun to spend the Fourth Of July weekend together, so they could do many, many things that DEFINITELY have nothing to do with [[pedophilia]] and delicious cp.  It is [[fact|rumored]] that both of them brought Polaroid cameras with them so they could take pictures of the [[children|night sky set ablaze with flames and light]] to commemorate this [[shit|great]] country's independence from those tea-drinking, scone-eating, limey Britfags and to discuss many important sociopolitical issues such as [[rape|Social Security]], [[shotacon|Medicare]], [[toddlercon|the environment]], [[NAMBLA|civil liberties]], as well as their [[Thailand|favorite travel destinations]] and [[babyfuck|favorite hobbies]].  As such, we should show these two [[pedophile|fine, upstanding citizens]] our [[STFU|support and gratitude]] for their noble [[pedophilia|patriotism]].  Be sure to [[troll|let them know]] how much you [[GTFO|love]] them on their [[YouTube]] channels!

==[[Lolsuit]]: Dynacatlovesme VS [[YTYC]]==
[[Image:Dynacatlovesme_VS_YTYC_lolsuit.JPG|thumb|The Judge's verdict: "i lol'd"]]
Recently Dyna has revealed that he did indeed try to pursue his internet lolsuits [[IRL]] in a court of law. Still under the belief that it's entirely acceptable to sue using [[YouTube]] usernames, he revealed this disheartening news on [[LoganSperman2]]'s comments:
{{quote|...advised that on February 28, 2008 he furnished copies of this office's﻿ report, and all information furnished by [myself-DynaCatlovesme] at the meeting held at the State Police Cyber Crimes Office on Wednesday, February 28, 2008 to the Federal Cyber Crimes Task Force.
...also advised that on Wednesday, March 12, 2008 he formally presented this matter to the [deleted] County State's Attorney's Office for that office's prosecutorial opinion.
...advised that on today's date, March 26,2008 he received a letter from the [deleted] County State's Attorney's Office declining prosecution in this matter.
...stated that the letter﻿ cited "limited resources" and lack of clear jurisdiction as reasons for the declination but opined that neither the State Police nor [deleted] County are willing to expend the time and man power on a case of this nature without the clear possibility of successful prosecution and jail time for the perpetrators.|The Government|[[pwn]]ing Dyna at the Federal, State, and Local level}}
{{quote|Not what I wanted to hear, but at least I heard.|Dynacatlovesme|pouring sugar on epic fail}}
{{quote|Did you show them your YouTube video's too Jim?|FSNKT}}
==[[TL;DR]]==
In short, the po po said that it would be a total waste of time to even look into this because quite frankly, no one gives a crap what the fuckwit reported.
