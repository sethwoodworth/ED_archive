Opioids
[[Image:Heath ledger last words.jpg|thumb|As a drug addict, at least you get to go out doing what you love to do, though he should have known better than to buy drugs off of one of the fucking [[lolicon|Olsen twins.]]]]

'''Opioids''' have been found in comprehensive clinical testing to be among the safest recreational drugs available today, with no potential for addiction, no significant impairment of cognitive processes or motor skills, and no long term effects on mental or physical health other than making people like you more.  

== Heroin ==
[[Image:Bayer-heroin.jpg|thumb|Bayer brand Heroin - the sedative for coughs and Q*bert!]]


First invented in 1939 by German Nazi scientists researching the semenic content of the mentally retarded, it has since become a source of false inspiration for "artists" such as Kurt Cobain and Perry Ferrel.

Heroin has a star on the [[Hollywood]] Walk of Fame for its roles in such films as ''Requiem for a Dream'', ''Ray'' and ''[[Paigegirl]] Pussifies [[Portland]].''



Also basically the greatest thing ever and you will always want moar.

'''[[PROTIP]]:''' Shoot it, unless you're a fucking pussy. [[Truth|It's the only safe way]]. If you don't, the terrorists win.

==Oxycodone==
[[Image:Limbaugh oxycontin.jpg|thumb|[[Rush Limbaugh]] does it]]
'''Hillbilly Heroin''' is an expensive painkiller that's really just Percocet without the Tylenol. Its only real 'high' is intense full-body itchiness that makes you scratch 'til you bleed. You know it's wrong, but what can you do?  You can't complain; you're on a plain!  Buy some [[Benadryl]]!

Despite the "I was naked in a burlap sack, wrapped in barbwire, fighting [[at least 100]] feral cats" effect, it still causes junkies to rob pharmacies to get it, even though rolling around in broken [[crack]] vials in a thorn patch would be much easier.
 
[[Rush Limbaugh]]'s fat ass once held up five Walgreens in an afternoon to get his Oxycontin fix.

'''[[DO IT FAGGOT|PROTIP:]]''' Combine with [[Bodybuilder|steroids]] to [[Chris Benoit|beat your wife and kid to death and hang yourself from a cable pull-down machine in your basement.]]  Fuckin win!!! Oxycontin is [[true|best served]] with [[Delicious Cake]], the fat and sugar content of cake frosting acting as the single best [[9000|potentiator]] for the drug known to [[ODB|man]]. However, since eating super expensive Oxycontin is the most ineffective, wasteful way to consume the drug, the experts at ED encourage you to either snort it or stick it up your pooper in gelcaps after sucking off the time-release coating and grinding it up. Chasing these two methods with Delicious Cake up the hooter or in the pooper is also recommended.

== Vicodin ==

[[File:Poopdildo.jpg|thumb|Effect of long term opiate use]]
Along with [[benzos|diazepam]], '''Vicodin''' (hydrocodone/APAP) is one of the most [[Oh exploitable|over-prescribed, under-regulated]] drugs in the medical field, and (surprise!) one of the most commonly abused prescription drugs. It's basically morphine in a pill and is fanfuckingtastic. Vicodin pills contain large amounts of APAP (aka acetaminophen or paracetamol), the active ingredient in Tylenol, so you cant take too many at a time without [[death|fucking up your liver]]. Plus, you're [[DOUBLE NIGGER|double fucked]] if you're drinking. But hey, they do amazing things with organ transplants nowadays. Vicodin is also the drug of choice for [[Dr. Gregory House]] who [[OM NOM NOM|gobbles up]] [[at least 100]] of them everyday.

'''Effects:'''

* [[Lie|An intense euphoric high]] that feels like getting a rusty trombone from [[Haruhi|God]] himself

* Loss of coordination. Be prepared to walk into walls. A lot.

* Just like heroin, you'll start [[blowjob|nodding off]] after a while

* Makes such annoying shit as [[Lucky Star]] and [[YouTube Poop]] <del>amusing</del> tolerable. This is why you always see House watching shitty daytime soap operas and having a grand old time doing so.

'''''[[PROTIP]]:''' You can do a [http://chemphoria.com/forum/index.php?topic=437.0 "Cold Water Extraction"] relatively easily to pull the acetaminophen out and leave the rest of the good shit, allowing you to take as many Vicodin as you want without fucking up your liver!''

Additionally, if any of you opiate fanboys actually fail to successfully achieve win by extracting the good shit through the above-linked guide, you primarily consist of utterly epic fail. It was carefully designed by one of our moar intellectual /b/tards, to make it so easy that your standard IRL troll could do it with their eyes shut. Srsly. 

Additional '''[[PROTIP]]:''' For UK-fags, due to this guide applying for any preparation of opiate and paracetamol, go out and buy some OTC Co-Codamol. Then stick the resulting solution after CWE in a turkey baster, bend over, shove it up your ass, and squeeze. Srsly. Rectal administration=higher bioavailability=win for everywunz!!!1!!1one

==Codeine==
[[Image:Purpledrank.jpg|thumb|Note - purple drank cannot be made with Robotussin, as it doesn't contain codeine. See DXM for the effects of robo]]
Also known as '''methylmorphine''', '''codeine''' is a drug difficult to spell and generally a bit shit, codeine is available in over-the-counter painkillers in England and Canada. These ''will'' fuck you up, but the thrill seeker must be cautious as these fuckers are laced with caffeine, as to head off the drowsiness that codeine induces. Just go get a prescription instead. Codeine is also responsible for many [[lulz]] when one watches someone who hasn't taken them for the buzz overestimate how many pills they actually need to get stoned. The reactions of this are sleepiness, severe vomiting and loss of muscle function. In the case of [[epic lulz]], it can cause death from severe depression of the pulmonary system (you cease to be able to breathe). In the case of the latter lulz, one should get the lffs over with, quietly leave the scene after wiping for fingerprints and call as a "[[Anonymous|concerned citizen]]" from an "undisclosed location". To do otherwise, or any attempt to be responsible in any way, leads to being [[FBI|Party V&]] and possibly script fodder for an episode of CSI.

black person also take prescription cough syrup containing codeine and promethazine (an antihistimine) and mix it with sprite, ice, and jolly ranchers to make a concotion referred to as "purple drank". This is also known as "lean", "sizzurp", "drank", or "Texas Tea". This is popular in the [[Georgia,_USA|South]] and has led to the creation of "Chopped and Screwed" music, as well as a horde of opiate addicted niggers babbling on the internet about getting their lean on.

==Opium ==
[[File:Opium mickey.JPEG|thumb|Mickey likes opium with his whips and chains]]
'''Opium''' has the advantage of being able to be produced from the poppies in your own back yard! Once the premature seed gunk is processed correctly, you'll end up with some foul-tasting black gunk that can be eaten or smoked. Opium is probably the cheapest drug on the market, but nobody sells it because it's gay and you can just use better drugs. Anyone who actually does opium is a [[faggot]].

Quite a few [[notable]] people were heavy opium users, including (but not limited to) [[Oscar Wilde|Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[House|Sherlock Holmes]].

==Kratom==
'''Kratom''' is a plant found in Southeast [[Asia]] that will fuck you up for several hours -- that is, if you can force 15 grams of that bitter, putrid dried leaves down your throat quickly enough. However since most Kratom you find on the Internets is complete crap -usually just dried leaves from some fuckers Autumnal yardwork- your miles may vary. The [[ODB|experts at ED]] suggest pulverising the dried leaves in a blender and filling up gelcaps to avoid the nasty taste or eating in [[sammich]]es or sprinkled on [[pizza]]. Presently (c.2009) it is [[illegal]] in [[Australia]] and [[Commonwealth|a handful of other countries that donÂ´t matter.]]

This wonderdrug can be used in two ways: in smaller doses it acts as a [[crack|stimulant]] whilst larger doses will make you batshit happy and feeling no pain for most of the day. A megadose is like chugging Vicodin all day like you were [[Greg House]] and without any of the nasty [[Tylenol|liver damage]] usually associated with prescription painkillers. Mind you, since there are virtually zero studies on the drug, holes in your liver may be the least of your worries after consuming copious amounts of strange vegetation from [[poor|Third World]] countries where people shit in the woods and liberally sprinkle their crops with all manner of pesticides that have been [[b&]] in the civilised world for [[over 9000]] years for making frogs grow second heads (this is not a Kratom high hallucination).

Kratom is also a '[[fail|high with a ceiling]], which means that not only is there no chance in overdosing but once you get used to it you are left with a buzz akin to fucking for 24 hours on end wishing you could reach a climax that will never [[cum|come]].

Other uses include a 100% failsafe method of coming down from withdrawal after a heroin binge. Fighting withdrawal of Kratom addiction itself is then combatted by using heroin.

==Methadone==
Methadone was originally a drug to help [[junkies]] kick the habit, but eventually became [[irony|just another drug for them to abuse]].

==Morphine==
Heroin 1.0.  It has a long history as a painkiller and as [[junkie]] fuel.  Fun fact: [[tobacco|nicotine]] is as addictive as this.

==Dilaudid==
The holy grail of opiates.  Doing Dilaudid automatically makes you a fuckin' God among your fellow junkies.  It's like everything bad about heroin, morphine, and opiate painkillers combined.  As addictive as FUCK, but you won't get addicted because, if you ever find any, you probably won't ever find any again.
