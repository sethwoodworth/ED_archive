''From the latimes.com article [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-shooting1nov01,0,5728150.story?coll=la-home-headlines Killer Sought Solace Online]''

In the weeks before 19-year-old William Freund went on a [[Rage|shooting rampage]] in his neighborhood, he reached out for [[Encyclopedia Dramatica:Help|help]] on the [[Internet]].

On Saturday morning, Freund put on a [[Bloodninja|dark cape and paintball mask]] and entered a neighboring house, killing two people. He then shot at a house across the street and tried to fire at a neighbor, but the shotgun jammed. Then he had butt sex with himself.

== Used the Internet ==

He wrote more than two dozen [[online]] messages in October, asking for a "[[In real life|real life]]" friend and saying he was contemplating [[suicide]]. He also threatened to start "[[Revenge of the Sith|a Terror Campaign to hurt those that have hurt me]]."

The messages paint a portrait of a troubled young man struggling with [[Asperger's syndrome]]. He revealed his anguish and frustration on a website, [http://www.wrongplanet.net wrongplanet.net], used by people with Asperger's.

On Oct. 15 he said he had tried [[suicide]] before. "Ive Tried Everythink from [[Suicide#Asphyxia|asphxia]], To lethal gases, Inert Gases To full suspended hanging … my minds Sick With [[depression]]."

The next day, he said that if he made it to [[Goths|Halloween]], he planned to equip himself with body armor, an airgun and a laser to "just scare any little kids that try to destroy my pumpkin … and guess what I have A real shotgun. [[Kill them in the face|It's gona be a fun Halloween]]," he wrote.

In a prophetic message written Oct. 16, he said, "[[God hates fags|Everybody hates me]]" and "I feel like I need to kill myself." He also disclosed that he had bought a 12-gauge shotgun and had gone online to buy ammunition.

On Oct. 19, he asked for references to a mental hospital, saying that he needed counseling and social skills training. He also said [[You Don't Have Any Friends|he had no friends]]. He wrote that he wished he had some, emphasizing it with 75 exclamation points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Members of the online community for Asperger's tried to reassure Freund and offer suggestions, and volunteer moderators tried to find his parents.

Surprisingly, their efforts '''FAILED'''.

== Liked Food ==

Freund tended to keep to himself, although he worked for a while repairing [[computers]] and fixing [[virus]]es.

"He was incredibly smart, but he lacked social skills severely," said his former employer. "He was a very deep thinker." 

In his online profile, Freund described himself as an only child of adoptive parents, a student at an [[ITT Tech|ITT Technical Institute]] who enjoyed "[[computers]], [[role-playing]], [[fantasy]], [[Furry|pugs]], [[Food]], [[guns]]." 

His online messages were filled with spelling and [[grammar|grammatical errors]] (i.e. "puckins"), alternately depicting a [[Victim complex|self-aware person desperately seeking help]] and a frustrated, angry man who wanted to lash out at others.

It should be noted that as a gun-obsessed teenage male [[faggot]] with Asperger's and an incredible depth of psychological problems, William Freund was, incredibly the archetypal [[Something Awful]] forum goon.
