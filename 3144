'''Furry-Furry.com''' (now known as '''furrytofurry.com''') is another "adult lifestyle" site for furries, which basically boils down loads of Krystal porn and OL yiffing. Like every other mature furry site before it, most threads are full of bitching about [[emo|how the hyoomans don't understand them]], roleplaying that involves a lot of wolf-sheaths and giant manatee bagina, and tips on how to spot fellow likeminded doghumpers in public areas (TIP: they're the ones also humping dogs). 90% of the user population is gay male or [[gay|bi-curious]] male and the rest is made of guys pretending to be sexy female foxes.

You can set up your profile with your user identity, "species", gender, and sexual "pre-fur-ence", all of which in no way defies the furry-spouted notion that being furry is [[lie|NOT ABOUT SEX]].

==It Ain't Jak Without the Yak==
F2F is run by a self-proclaimed [[internet celebrity]] named Jangbu, who is so [[attention whore|desperate for attention]] that he actually puts his own logo atop the rest of the page so his entire forum of [[basement dweller|basement dwelling]] yiff lovers can revel in how awesome he is. We're almost certain he'll end up posting his cock on the forum at some point.

{{squote|before I start to inundate you with information and instructions; I figure we should decide what sort of plushie you want. I make two different kinds. The first type I make has an armature inside so he can stand up and be posed; he also has a custom made opposable penis that also has an armature inside so you can bend it in all directions. The other type I make is basically the same without the armature and the penis is a store bought item. The one with out the armature has a canvases leave that the "butt" goes into; so basically he can be cleaned up after a good yiffin. The one with the armature doesn't. You can also use the same technique to create a female plush as well.|Jangbu}}

There are no words to describe the horrors of furry adult sites. Those who have seen wish they had not seen as well as actually googled furry to find this site. Those who have not seen must simply be thankful for that. The only way to adequately describe this kind of site is to quote its own members and threads.

"How Do You Masturbate" is, amazingly enough, the longest thread in this forum.  Because furries are so very ronery.
''Riku-San: What position do you masturbate in?''

''brainsickness:  I usually sit down, but I'm gonna try upside down in a few minutes''

(second post ten hours later)

''brainsickness: OK it didnt work. You guys have any suggestions on how to get upside down''

(third post one hour later)

''brainsickness: I haven't used any unusual positions, but i have recently started to use a homemade cockring (just a rubberband) which feels pretty good. Although this could get a bit dangerous. Once I wraped it around myself one too many times i guess and couldn't get it off. I finally used some scissors... very very carefully''

(fourth post two hours later)

''brainsickness: i still don't get the physics of doing it upside down''

==Babyfur Forum==
[[Image:furry-furry4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Put shoe on head|Put pot on head]].]]
A place for babyfurs to congregate and talk about sippy cups and shitting themselves.

|Furry is not sexual in itself and therefore any kind of other attributes can be combined. I am sure there will some day be a furry serial killer. A BabyFur is not a pedophile, but there have been cases where RL pedophiles have gone after BabyFurs. <b>I like the analogy that a pedophile wants a child, while a BabyFur wants to be a child. Taking this further a heterosexual male wants a female, while a transvestite wants to be a female.
This means that "heterosexual male" is a pedophile.</b> 
I am annoyed with the legal decision to make human child drawings illegal in Germany in an attempt to to make law enforcement's job easier.

==Otherkin Forum==

Where the highest amounts of self-delusion go down.  Otherkin share their experiences 'shifting', i.e. pretending they [[Fuck you, I'm a dragon!|TOTALLY OMG TURNED INTO AN ANIMAL, NOBODY SAW BUT I SWEAR IT HAPPENED.]]

|No one can quiz you to see if your otherkin no more than I can decide if you believe in god.

==Plushie Forum==

Filled with furries validating their plushophilia by saying that if not for the plushies, they would literally have [[virgin|no one else in their lives]]:

I've yet to take it in the butt, and I wager it'll be a while.|kcoar
|I'm allergic to dogs and I have no RL girlfriend at this time, so my plushies are pretty much all I have.|C-Prime
|Before I became a furry I had no plushies and used to sleep with extra pillows and hug them. I donÂ´t feel so alone with plushies.|Peking
|I slept with my white teddy from when I was 6 months old, to about two years ago. I still do when I feel really empty... Which happens to be about once a month...|Bane
|Last night, I lost my plushie virginit to a huge stuffed wolf that I've had for ages... I made a little hole in the bottom and had to tear it open even more so I could fit. I loved it! I was almost screaming after five minutes and went at my plushie again and again...|Wolfin on [[raep]]

|While I dont support Pedophilia, I have to ask, If these pictures were taking with your sisters knowledge, I would ignore them. I feel particularly that 18 is such an arbitrary age to label someone as an adult, and I feel that what you know about your sister should be taken into account here. If you believe that your sister was taken advantage of, snooped on, photographed without her knowledge etc or there are pics of much younger kids then yes defiantly call the police. However, if it was consensual I think that this should be something dealt with within the family.|FallenGreyWolf

==Art Board==


Typical art forum where half the posters are whoring their crappy animal porn and the other half are begging for crappy animal porn.



User bloodwolfe does not know how to use teh Google:

{{quote|i cant find a good site for dragon yiff plz help me out?

Ragnarok, I have no idea who could possibly help you on this crazy mission of yours.  It just sounds like a pipe dream to me:

{{quote|Does anybody know where to find yiffy stories about that hot blue fox "Krystal" from starfox?|}}


ZimbabweYiffy86 is too much of a lazy fuck to even google his own porn, so he makes other users bring it to him. And they do.

{{quote|I wanna see your hottest yiff pic. It doesn't matter what it is, if it apeals to you, show it to the world! |}}

Yeah, that definitely is the hottest damn thing I've ever seen.

==Roleplay Examples==
Users CrossedOut and Tay are very tactical lovers who love to do some action!


<i>
Tay: She smiled and said:
"Finnaly, there is no shame of loosing against you. You are a really good fighter. I'm honnored to serve you."
She bowed politly.

CrossedOut: "Thanks, you're very tactical when it comes to fighting." He said smiling, bowing back. "I suppose we should both clean ourselves."

Tay:  "Well..I kinda like being covered by mud before or after doing some..action.."
She smiled seductivly.

CrossedOut:  Well, it's not fun having dried mud on your fur." He said shrugging, noting the tone to her voice and smiled. "Action you say?"

Tay:  "Yup. Action. You like that?"
She crossed her arms in her back, exposing her breasts.

CrossedOut:  "Maybe." He said, walking over to her, looking at her body covered in mud, now his sheath throbbing.

|I'd hate to be around them especially they like killing animals for food and or for there hide to use on clothing. *SIGH* can't they do something else that will make us like them because right now I wanna kill all of those mundanes because some of them won't except us for who we are and what we like to do and all they wanna do is insult us and make us look like the bad guys.|

|Well humans are a difficult species. I really like some of them but I do not like the human race in general. Humans are cruel and they are the only species that likes killing others just for fun.
OK, when I take a look in the mirror I see a human being too, but unfortunately I had no choice to choose....|

|well humans are ok, even my mate is a human. she nice, but talks a little to much for my liking. but with some luck i could "convert" her, but who knows.|

I mean... umm... them lovable...little things...|
