[[Terrorism]]: achieving a goal through the use of fear or threats. 

Despite popular belief, trolling is not a form of terrorism. Calling some one a fatty on the [[internets]] doesn't equal the Jews doing [[WTC]].

That being said, terrorism is also a highly effective way of [[IRL troll]]ing. In recent years it has become increasingly popular as [[Muslims]] are crazy fucks and [[USA]] needs [[moar]] death, although it is acceptable as it's done for the [[lulz]].

==History==

Terrorism can be found everywhere in [[media]] and [[media|culture]]. It is found in the writings of the notorious [[Cthulhu|H.P. Lovecraft]] to the movies of terrorist Jew. The main focus of terrorists is to make people laugh. Groups of people often pay [[at least 100|at least one million dollars]] to be subjected to terrorism.

Terrorism often features [[fire|explosion]]s. [[IRL]] terrorism is not as fun, because often the explosions occur far away from the people being terrorized and are never seen, or are shot on hand-held cameras instead of film and when shown, are simply repeated constantly. Many people still watch for hours however, as [[RL]] heightens the [[drama]], regardless of the fact that most of the time the long-awaited second explosion does not occur. One of the best examples of terrorism is the one-day only [[Old media|CNN]] movie [[9/11]] which [[irony|ironically]] was shot on September 11th, 2001. Such high levels of drama caused many people to go [[batshit]] [[crazy]]. This is the mark of a good [[RL]] terrorist director.

Many people turn into [[pussies]] and/or [[Republicans]] when watching a good bit of terrorism. One problem with terrorism is that a good dose can encourage people to [[emo|cut themselves]], or sometimes [[murder|cut other people]], or start a [[war]], or, as we will see, even start a war on terror itself.

==War on Terror==

[[Image:Terror alert system.jpg|thumb|Terror alert system fixt]]

[[At least 100 years]] ago, a Saudi Princess named [[Osama bin Laden]] had sand in his vagina and was recruited by the [[government]] to become a terrorist. He lived in [[Iraq]] and wished to find a way to protect himself from getting sand in his vagina, so the [[CIA]] taught him how to terrorize people and how to train others to terrorize people. As it is [[common knowledge]] that the itch of a sandy vagina can induce [[cutting]], [[fucktard|geniuses]] at the CIA believed that cutting other people may remove sand from a vagina. However, the sand did not decrease, and, unbeknownst to the CIA, the drama of bin Laden's terrorism greatly increased. After a while, Bin Laden disappeared. Later he re-appeared and blew up [[America]]. It has been theorized that bin Laden may have a [[centipede filled vagina]] or in some cases, even a scorpion filled vagina.

Bin Laden's drama made the CIA very angry, as he had been specifically told not to do that. It also made Americans angry. Most Americans wanted to [[murder]] bin Laden. Instead, [[George Bush]], the head ruler of America, decided murdering bin Laden was not enough, and said that fear itself needed to be stopped. So, he declared a '''war on terror'''. This is not what he wanted to actually do, of course, because it is [[fucking stupid]]. Instead of fighting scariness like he promised [[conservative]]s, he just conquered two countries instead. This, he said, was all part of America's battle against scary things for Americans, when really it was all part of the [[Illuminati]]'s battle against their not having enough power or money. Bush made sure to tell everyone how scary the countries  were ahead of time, even though he, like everyone else at the time, didn't really give two [[shit]]s about them. Eventually, Bush's plan is to conquer the world. See [[George Bush]] for more on his plans.

==Glasgow Bombing==
Nowadays many events and instances around the world are misinterpreted as terrorism by police and the [[Fox_News|world media]] with a majority of people believing this too. This is mainly attributed to the [[Jews|worldwide Jewish conspiracy]], who control all governments and media, and like to use terrorist attacks as an excuse to lock up [[Arabs]] and piss off ragheads in [[Palestine]], [[lol]].

One recent “terrorist attack” is an example of this: the bombing of Glasgow International Airport bombing on 30 June 2007. This chain of events was set into motions weeks before however when agents of MI7, two levels above MI5, were on a routine undercover sweep of [[Scotland]] and made a terrifying find. This discovery was an airport just outside of Glasgow, a chance for the imprisoned Scotch people to escape their eternal [[jail]] where they had been imprisoned for so many centuries. This very thought terrified the top brass of MI7 knowing that surely the Scotch would all travel south to kill the [[Queen]] and then destroy the [[English]] way of life, it’s what every Scotch person wants.

As such, weeks later a flaming [[car]] was driven into one of the terminals of this airport but due to a leak from MI7 soon the whole world knew of this. The rest of the world, not knowing the true evil of the Scotch people and their jealousy of the continental ways of the English, presumed that [[omg|ZOMGZZ!!!12!]] A terrorist attack!!

However, this was obviously not the case. Even though Glasgow is industrial nowadays the rest of the Scotland is a [[Africa|Third World country]] in most respects, even the Scotch would be the first to admit this. If it doesn't have a [[capitalism|Starbucks]] then Osama doesn't give a shit. The truth was that the Queen had given Doc Emmet Brown and [[Michael_J_Fox|Michael J Fox]] handjobs in return for them using the flux capacitor to go back in time to Scotland and stopping the airport from ever being built. 

Due to a combination of Doc Brown skimping by using Wilkinson's own brand batteries instead of plutonium in his flux capacitor and ol’  Mikey J Fox having the shakes, the car drove straight into the airport instead of past it and the whole thing just got blown the fuck up. Fox even [[fail|fhailed]] so bad he didn’t even kill any Scotch in the process. Most experts agree however that Teen Wolf probably wouldn’t have fucked it all to pieces.

Incidentally, the terminal attack was completely pointless as the Muslims, far from actually killing anyone, set fire to themselves and fingered themselves while crying to Allah to "shove his Asian cock up their batty creases."

==Lulzy Terrorism==
Terrorism can also be used for great lulz. When two [[hippies]] attacked the city of [[Boston]] using their hairstyles, sracks were brit. See [[Boston]] for more information on their great lulzy martyrdom.

On 9/11/2008 a [[retard]] in Syosset told his health teacher he was scared of terrorists coming back. Much [[lulz]] ensured as students pointed out that security guards did not carry guns. The [[retard]] then never returned to class.
