Some Guy
==Who and What==
Some Guy is acknowledged by the staff of [[Wikipedia]] to have done everything ever, both [[IRL]] and [[OTI]], including the creation of Wikipedia itself. Some Guy has made both [[MySpace]] and [[Google]]. He has also made famous fictional characters such as [[Magical Trevor]] and [[Super Mario]], all the while keeping Ozzy Osbourne famous. If you are unsure of who did something, it is acceptable to credit it to Some Guy until it is proven that it was actually done by [[#Someone Else]].

Some Guy likes to pop into people's pictures they take while outside. He rarely interferes with people's daily lives, but he's always there. Watching. Waiting. He also does all the [[graffiti]] around the world, hence why it's uniform in appearance and total [[crap]].
 
==Other Information==
Some Guy has teamed up in the past with Those Other Guys to do many great things, such as inventing [[Starcraft]], running [[the FBI]], and doing [[9/11]].

However, Some Guy is not to be confused with the following individuals.

===That Other Guy===
A former member of Those Other Guys, That Other Guy has since broken free of their society to do many things on his own that counter the actions of Some Guy and Those Other Guys, such as starting [[MyCrib]] and [[The Suckage]], as well as inventing [[World of Warcraft]].

===Some Jerk===
Some Jerk is that guy who stole your coat, scratched your car, or stole your [[girlfriend]] [[IRL]]. Not to be confused with...

===That Bastard===
Every [[woman]] knows That Bastard. He's the insensitive [[asshole]] who mistreated one or more of their female friends at one point or another.

===Some Hobo===
Some Hobo has lived on every street in America at one point or another. He usually lives in a cardboard box and asks for sandwiches.

===Dat Nigga===
That random Black guy that you see, who does everything that Some Guy does, but he's black so therefore he is never given any credit unless it involves a crime.
