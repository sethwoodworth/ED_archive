==Start of darkness==
The [[neckbeard]] that gets paid to draw and write this crap was responsible for another inane [[Manga|backward comic]] [[Love Hina|Love Hina.]] Originally, the faggot wanted to flood the market with another trite shounen title, but the top editors vetod that shit, favoring flooding the market with a shitty shojo title instead. Being butthurt over not getting to make a another shounen series, he came up with a [[Fail|brilliant]] idea to fuck the suits over: Over time, he would evolve his shitty magic school harem with tired character designs of a manga into a shitty AKSHUN series filled with [[Harry Potter|unoriginal ideas]] and [[DBZ|plots that don't go any where for months at a time.]] [[Image:Gettoknowthem.png|right|thumb|Get to know your student body!]]
It goes just as well as you'd expect it to.

It was picked up to be made into an anime and was released on a unsuspecting public causing [[Weaboo|weaboos]] and [[TVTropes]] editors to cream themselves everwhere. But then, by some miracle of God, it was picked up again. Then AGAIN. With another one ''on the way.'' Not to mention the Live Action Series, and the spin off that turns Negi into a adult pedo teaching kindergarten. [http://www.mangafox.com/manga/negiho_ito_bun/ Srly.]

==Summary==

Negi Springfield is a wizard from [[Wales]] that has come to Japan all so he can teach a class full of high school [[jailbait]] [[Japan|Japs]] [[ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT|how to speak English.]] Apparently, he has to do this instead doing something worthwhile and less boring with his powers like killing [[Jews]], [[Blacks|Niggers]], and other uppity minorities [[For Great Justice|for the Crown]], is so that he can become a ''Magister Magi'' or ''[[Naruto|Hokage]]'' or whatever the fuck it's called, and be able to track down his father, [[original character|Nagi Springfield.]] Oh and Negi is only 10 years old. [[Lie|Of course, this all makes perfect sense and there is a logical explanation for everything.]] 

Being a predictable harem series, his entire class ends up falling for him. Boring and played out antics ensue. But wait, [[lie|this isn't your typical harem series!]] This series gets intentionally derailed into a terrible shounen series, complete with loli vampires, lesbian samurais, [[Matrix|chicks that know kung fu]], 1337 snipers, a key operated robot girl, some of the most obnoxious fanservice ever, and some other stupid shit that a lot more boring than it sounds.

==Characters, characters everywhere==

There were way too fucking many characters when it started out and it only got worse as the series went on.

===Major Characters===

===[[User:Negi_Springfield|Negi Springfield]]=== 

Not Harry Potter is the main character and resident [[shota]] of the series. For some reason, he has to go to Japan to teach English and get sexually harassed by high school girls instead of doing something useful or interesting. He has a tendency to [[Sharking|sneeze the skirts off of his students.]] 

===[[Bitch|Asuna Kagurazaka]]===

Aka [[shit no one cares about|Asuna Vesperina Theotanasia Entheofushia]] is the generic tsundere. [[LOLWUT|Apparently, she's some kind of anti-magical construct that's a member of royalty which somehow might make her Negi's Aunt somehow.]] Yeah. Also has them [[Rozen Maiden|Boatlights]] going on.

===[[Lesbian|Setsuna Sakurazaki]]===

Super serious jailbait with a stupid haircut, even for an anime. Seriously, it's like she couldn't decide what hairstyle she wanted, so she went with both. Supposed to be a super awesome half demon winged samurai, but proves to be useless most of the time. Is in the closet about being a lesbian for Konoka.
