In AD 2008, War was beginning. Since [[last Thursday]] the [[Arabs]] in the [[Palestine|Gaza Strip]] have been shooting [[dongcopter|rockets]] into [[Israel]] because the [[Jews]] have been [[pools closed|blockading]] the [[Palestine|region]] to stop the [[Arabs]] A) from shooting said [[dongcopter|rockets]] and/or B) getting [[food]]. Its a beautiful system eh?  Anyway It all came to a head when the [[Jews]] got bored of a temporary cease fire and decided to [[buttsecks|surprise buttsecks]] the Arabs and [[Raid|invaded]] the region, [[I Am In Your Base Killing Your D00ds|killing about everyone]].  Needless to say it was time for some collateral payback and Jew rage of epic proportions.  Much butthurt and BAWWWWWWW ensued and like with every tragic event in the news lately, so did the lulz.

==How it all began==
[[Image:Awesome3.jpg|right|thumb|What the [[Americunts|Americans]] think of the whole thing]]
[[Image:Ganfart.jpg|right|thumb|God's chosen people protect teh [[lie|country]]  ]]
If you attend public school, you may not be aware why joo's and the Chickpea people are fighting over such a shitty piece of land in the first place. Well toward's the end of WWII, Churchill, Stalin, and President Michael Wilson were all thinking "OMGWTFBBW what are we going to do with all of these Jews?" Rather than say, intergrate them into their societies they decided to dump them all in their "ancestral homeland" or something. Well it turns out that when you do not live in a location for over a thousand years, other [[terrorists|people]] have a tendency to mosey on down and [[dibs|setup shop]]. But seeing as these "other people" who setup shop were Muslims, nobody really gave a shit as they'd probably only use the land to manufacture suicide bombs anyway.


Since the only thing more annoying than living with Jews is talking to Arabs, the Allies helped the Jews [[Awesome|establish a state with as little input from the people currently living there as possible]]! And so began the 20th century's greatest mistake, Israel.


<center><youtube>j61ktUeDDuo</youtube><br>[[Israel]] explaining [[final_solution|why they must finish off the palestinians.]] [[Irony|Ironically]] in this apparently [[shit|very detailed and precise video]], they forgot to mention the fact that they imposed a blockade on Gaza which left the [[Arabs]] starving and dying of a shitload of diseases. How cute!</center>

==Why so hilarious?==
[[Image:Hamas rally.jpg|right|thumb|Hamas showing their love of [[lulz]]]]
[[Image:It'sTimeForGiys, Brother.jpg|left|thumb|How Israeli soldiers look like. [[truth|hawt]] [[Jailbait|9th-grader]] (<- there can't be jewgirls that cute, cosplay pic)]]
In its efforts to spread [[War|peace and democracy]] throughout the Middle East, the [[United States]] thought it would be a [[No|good idea]] to let [[Arabs|people who uniformly despise Israel]] hold elections to choose who should lead them . This resulted in [[Epic Fail]] as the Palestinians overwhelmingly elected the [[Terrorist|evildoers]] of Hamas in a [[Epic Win|landslide]] victory. As [[democracy]] and [[freedom]] rang throughout the West Bank and Gaza, [[George Bush|Bush]] and [[Israel]] initiated a desperate effort to [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING]] and when this failed began to [[BAWW]] about how bad the future for the Palestinians will be under Hamas.

[[TL;DR]] Hamas [[pwnt|won]] and nobody could say [[Shit]].

For awhile all was calm until 2007 when Hamas decided to [[Rape]] the Palestinian authorities Fatah party and kicked them out of Gaza. It then proceeded to [[troll]] [[Israel]] with rockets and blockade breaking, which is pretty weak ass shit as these rockets were about as dangerous as [[dongcopter]]s. When asked why they were continuing to [[spam]] [[Israel]] with ineffectual rocket attacks, Hamas leaders simply stated that they were doing it for the [[lulz]]. Unfortunately for Hamas though, Israel likes lulz too, and bombed Gaza back. Eventually, [[Redneck|Jimmy Carter]] went over and met with Ham-ass terrorists, and tried to negotiate a cease-fire with Israel. Hamas pretended to keep their end of the deal while secretly digging a tunnel into Israel in order to capture a soldier and exchange him for terrorists in Israeli rapehouses. Too bad for them, Israel found out all about it. First, it sent some infantry and tanks and bulldozers to launch a [[Surprise sex|surprise raid into Gaza]], where they destroyed the tunnel and pwnt a terrorist. Hamas was not too happy, so they launched some mortars at the Jew invaders, but then Israeli jets bombed the mortar positions and blew up five more terrorists. Bawwww.

Hamas then began firing rockets into Israel again, which Israel responded to by bombing Gaza and killing one, that's right, just one pesky Shitslamist. Then, Hamas tried to raid Israel again, but IDF soldiers caught them trying to blow up the Israel-Gaza [[Mexico|border fence]], and killed three of them. But those pesky rockets would not stop, and since Israel's mission is to make Jews safe, it decided to attack Gaza and just [[Holocaust|finish them off]].

Thus began their 2 week mission to kill [[Over 9000|as many]] Palestinian's as they can. With [[Kill it with fire|white napalm]]. Or at least smash as many windows as possible.

To avoid any confusion when Israel gets accused of [[genocide|war crimes]] when the bullets finally stop flying, [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aqhXg9VD8v6o&refer=home the Jews sent a battalion of lawyers] into Gaza.

==And the shit just began to roll==

[[Image:Godzillagaza.jpg|right|thumb|What the western media refuses to show you]]
[[Image:GazaPic1.jpg|right|thumb|A random person took a pic of the war]]

In response to Hamas’ [[faggotry]] Israel decided the best course of action was to begin an [[epic]] bombing of Gaza in the hopes of [[Holocaust|killing all the Muslims once and for all]]. Cue the drama.

Israeli planes and gunboats and artillery guns began pounding Gaza, killing hundreds of Hamas fighters and <s>human shields</s> INNOCENT CIVILIANS. Hamas stole all the aid Israel sent into Gaza for themselves, and did not help civilians or even let them flee, choosing instead to tape civvie suffering for world sympathy. All of the blood and corpses and destruction was displayed over and over again, and Jews who also die do not deserve all the attention anyway. The Israeli Navy also used their advanced missile boats to sink the entire Hamas navy (just a couple of rustbucket boats, no achievement there).  Hamas reacted to the bombings by lobbing off some of their rockets and mortars, forgetting that they were the cause of this shit in the first place. They killed three innocent civilians and a soldier, and hoped that Israel would now be [[bullshit|scared out of invading Gaza]]. [[Iran]] tried to join in on the fun and get more weapons into Gaza, so they organized a convoy to head from [[Sudan]] to Gaza filled with all kinds of fun toys for Hamas, but surprise surprise! Israel knew all about it, and sent a bunch of planes to bomb the shit out of it, blowing up all the weapons and killing everyone in it, including some Iranian [[Terrorist|Revolutionary Guard]]s, causing major bawwwing in Sudan.

==Gaza gets raeped==

Concerned that they were not killing the [[Muslims]] fast enough, the Jew decided that they should send the ground forces in, after a massive artillery shelling. In every serious clash, they would kill dozens of Ham-ass fags, and in one case killed about 100. The Jews would usually lose a few wounded, but in five cases an IDF soldier actually died.  In another instance four IDF men died by friendly fire, just like Amerofags in [[Iraq]] while [[stealing|liberating]] <s>Kuwait</s> oil. The IDF quickly conquered a lot of Gaza, and used its skills in street fighting to conquer most of Gaza city. As well as slaughtering Hamas fighters with low Israeli casualties, they also stole a bunch of Iranian-supplied military shit and took it back to Israel.

== International reactions ==

This caused all the [[Liberals]] in [[Europe]] to [[BAWW]] about the [[Shit_Nobody_Cares_About|humanitarian crisis in Gaza brought on by the war]].  All the while the [[Americunts]] enter a state of pure bliss as more and more [[collateral_damage|Palestinians]] get [[permabanned]]. Heeding the will of its people, the [[Government|US Government]] provided cover for [[Israel]] at the [[UN]] in the hopes that the [[Jews]] will be able to push the body count even higher. 

The Arab world reacted with its usual [[Rage|calm approach to things]]. [[France]] immediately demanded that both sides surrender, and when it became clear they would not, offered to do it themselves. France formalized its surrender to [[Israel]] both Israel and Hamas just to be on the safe side, and the French president visited Jerusalem and Gaza City to negotiate the final terms. The [[UN]] immediately [[fail|failed]] to pass a resolution demanding immediate talks aimed at passing a resolution to discuss the crisis. While all the [[Americunts]] immediately grabbed their 2 liter bottles of Soda, an extra large bag of Cheetos and sat down in front of the TV to watch the [[Jews]] kill [[Arabs]]. This last, of course, accompanied by a non-stop barrage of [[liberal]] Hamas fantards on CNN and MSNBC begging the Jews to crawl back into the ovens.

Except [[Foxnews|FOX News]].  They provided [[bullshit|poignant news analysis]] explaining how the IDF was [[Rip and Tear|showing care and restraint]].

== El Fin ==

[[Image:Epic-fail-guy-dance.gif|thumb|Hamas militant seen celebrating Hamas' declaration of victory]]

Israel has declared a unilateral cease-fire in the fighting in Gaza beginning at 2 a.m. Sunday (7 p.m. ET Saturday), Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said.

{{morphquote|mqtest2|background-color: lightgrey; width: 80%; height: 200px;|font-weight: bold;
|"We can say that the conditions have been brought about that enable us to say that the aims that we laid down for the operation have been completely achieved."|Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ,speaking from the Hamas Leader's bed.
|"If foes decide to continue to fight against us, then we will be ready and we shall consider ourselves justified in replying."|Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, speaking from the right side of afore-mentioned bed.
|"In the name of Allah, the merciful and most high, we successfully flattened the tire of a Zionist humvee, praise Allah. The Zionists should be warned that they have one week to flee Gaza or else, god willing, we shall flatten the other three tires on the humvee and attempt to blow it up with our horribly inaccurate RPG's".|Supreme Leader Of Hamas.
}}


For its part, Israel said any effort to disrupt the ceasefire from now until [[catnarok|doomsday]] on the part of Hamas will mean a resumption of the war. For now though, [[IS_IT_CAN_BE_HUGS_TIEM_NOW_PLEES%3F|there is peace]]. But will it [[no|hold]]?

Israel said that it won because of the massive assrape it gave to Gaza, because it advanced deep into Gaza and Hamas couldn't do shit about it, and because only 13 Jews died, 4 of them accidentally killed by other Jews. Hamas said it won because it still could shoot off some rustbucket rockets at Israel by the end of the war, because not ''everyone'' of them was killed and not ''everything'' was destroyed, and because people who already hated Jews now hated Jews more. That's a funny kind of victory, don't you think?

==TL;DR==
[[Image:Zonistsdefending.jpg|thumb|right| Jew defending [[israel|Jerusalem]] from [[catnarok|destruction]] by sandnigger hordes]]
[[Last Thursday|A long time ago]] [[Jesus]] conquered Israel using his army of [[Christians|idiots]]. Skip 5 years and [[Hitler|God]] kills most of the [[Jews]] in what was later dubbed the [[lolocaust]]. Following this [[Epic Fail|near triumph]], the "West" decided to implement a [[Final Solution|better solution]] and dump all the [[Jews]] in a country surrounded by [[Muslims|other people nobody cares about]] who hate their guts more than us. This plan backfired when some of the [[jews|dirty rats]] infiltrated [[America]] and started selling the [[Jews]] [[1337|1337 h4x]] that made the Arab hate [[US|you]]. Now that created many [[lulz]] such as [[9/11]] but also many [[anti-lulz]] such as [[Israel|the continued existence of those backstabbing cuntfucks]].

So to summarize [[the game|you just lost the game]]

== Front Row Seats ==

Not content with just [[old media|watching CNN and reading news articles]] about this little [[Cat fight|lovers quarrel]]?  Want a little something [[MOAR]]?  Well how about a front row seat to the action?  Well that would be [[stupid]], you would get hit by a rocket or some other [[AIDS|Jew/Arab shit]].  Even better, now you can get all the violence of [[war]] right from you comfort and safety of your own home.  Here are a bunch of links to various cameras streaming footage of the [[sandbox]] everyone seems so concerned with:

Although by now all the fun is far from over.


== Aftermath ==

Gaza has been decimated. The lives of many Islamic terrorists have been lost. But don't worry. There is still ample opportunity for double-standards and satire to be applied widely.

[[Image:Jew Double Standard.png|center|Leftist propaganda poster.]]
<center>Maybe when Jihadi's start wearing military uniforms, their victims can called 'casualties of war' also.</center>

== Awww, shucks, Gaza, you're welcome. ==

In an odd twist of fate some towelheads will be thanking Israel for this one.  Not publicly, of course:

HAMAS teaches the Palestinian children about peace only.

==PROFIT!!1!==

Relax.
Those 1300 Gazans didn't die in [[fail|vain]].
Their deaths paved the way to an entire 11minutes of online Flash! game entertainment for you to [[FAP|enjoy]].
