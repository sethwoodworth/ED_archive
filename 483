'''Angry Grandpa''' ('''Charlie Green''') is the lulziest bi-polar person on YouTube, and quite possibly [[epic win|the world's most hilarious trailer trash Grandpa]].  The Angry Grandpa series on Youtube features him getting [[piss]]ed off for [[no]] reason, yelling at inanimate objects, swearing like a back street [[negro]], throwing food/trash all over the place, and telling [[children]] that there's no such thing as Santa Claus(even though he could quite easily pass for a mall Santa).  All of the videos are filmed by his [[fat]]-fuck son, Michael, and his girlfriend, [[Bridget|Bridgette]].

==Beginnings==
[[Image:My_Photos_damn_belt_popped_Angry_Grandpa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|I could probably fit in his stomach.]]
The lulz began with the first video ever, where Angry Grandpa [[No Cussing Club|swear]]s in front of his grandkids and tells them that there ain't no Santa Claus.  This is an indication that Angry Grandpa may very well be Santa Claus in hiding, and many conspiracy theorists and basement dwellers have tried to expose Angry Grandpa for who he is but as of [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]] they have been unsuccessful.

Ever since the first video gained enough [[fanboi]]s, dozens more videos emerged, all of which are fucking funny(except for the ones where Angry Grandpa blogs. Michael is whoring grandpa out to [[Mtv]] and some [[White Trash]] [http://heymanhustle.craveonline.com/  wresting website].

==DVD==

'''Michael''' made a DVD of grandpa fucking Tina and is [http://angrygrandpa.net/buydvd selling it] so his fat ass doesn't have to work. That way he can continue making his shitty [[wigger|rap]] music.

==The Cast==

'''Charlie 'Angry Grandpa' Green''' - An old angry fuck with bi-polar [[disorder]], causing him to spin out of control at any given moment.  Has been banned from Wal-Mart for smashing a jar of jelly against the wall.  He complains about Michael being jobless and about people being on welfare, even though he doesn't work and cries whenever his [[poor|food stamps]] don't come in on time. He has a large growth on his stomach that looks very similar to a beer belly. 

'''Michael Green''' - Camera guy, jobless [[fatass]], and an overall [[faggot]].  His only redemption in life is when he posts the latest video of his asshole dad(Angry Grandpa) and his white trash family. He is also a shitty raper named [http://www.myspace.com/lyricold Lyricold]. He is actually [[DO NOT WANT| a Mexican Rosie O'Donnell]] in disguise. He's 23.

'''Tina Green''' - Angry Grandpa's old wench.  Only married Angry Grandpa because she was [[pregnant]], instead of getting an abortion since white trash such as herself are too stupid/poor to get one. As the sole breadwinner of the family, Tina works as housekeeping maid (read: cleans toilets) at a motel. Tina is also obsessed with Elvis Prestley and spends hundreds on collectibles.  

'''Bridgette West''' - Michael's girlfriend.  Probably the only normal-looking person in the series.  Sometimes recording with a second camera and does pranks with Michael.  She's [[underage|17]].

'''Jennifer''' - Michael's older sister and mother of the children in the first video.  A minor recurring character. Also a total whore, she'll fuck anything that [[You|moves]] and she has horrific teeth.

== YouTube Breaks Grandpa ==
After having Grandpa turn down a total of 4 partnerships, YouTube got all [[butthurt]] and deleted Michael's account, removing all Angry Grandpa videos from YouTube.  Hordes of basement-dwellers found themselves with nothing to watch last Tuesday when they searched for Angry Grandpa's next abomination on YouTube.

Angry Grandpa now has his own website.[http://angrygrandpa.net]
