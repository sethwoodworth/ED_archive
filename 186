A winner is you
<center>[[Image:A_winner_is_you.jpg]]</center>

You're good enough, smart enough, and god dammit, people like [[You|you]]. Some people say that you're a [[loser]], but those people are the real losers. What they don't know is that pimples are cool, [[Goggles|glasses]] are cool, and being [[Fat|overweight]] is cool too. Dreaming about [[incest|fucking your sister]] is kind of [[sick|cool]] too. How many of those the real losers dream about fucking their sister? [[Noone|None of them]]. That's right. You're the real winner here. It's cool to be  [[Original character|unique]] and it makes you a winner too. '''A winner is you''' originates from the [[nintendo|NES]] video game ''Pro Wrestling''. The context it appeared in was when you won a match. Also stylized as "winner is you". The game [[Mars|Red Faction]] used this meme in 2001. In multiplayer, in the event of a tie, the announcer will proclaim "A winner is you!" instead of "Player 1" or "Player 2", as with a regular [[win]].
