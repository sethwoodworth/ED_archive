In 2011 (Claimed [[Lies|2009]]), some fag "conceptualized" a game a lot like like [[ROBLOX]], as in a complete ripoff. The result was the same thing, but even worse.

Theses are the parts of the [[original content|site]] and how to use them:

*Uploads
   *Step 1: select furry fetish art or [[goatse|generic shock images]].
   *Step 2: make a lulzy title and description while evading the retarded excuse for a filter.
   *Step 3: Spam the submit button to make pages and pages of the same shit

*World
   *Sit on your ass and do nothing

*Are you bored?
   *Troll the site rather than reading the latest steaming shitpile from the [[retard|site owner]].

*Forums
   *Troll and generate drama. Do you really need steps for this?!

*Market
   *Buy horse shit made with [[MSPaint]]

*People
   *Browse a list of alts, except for people mentioned in the following section.

*Premmium
   *Laugh at the site owner for thinking people will pay for this bullshit.

== Current Trolls ==

*Sheep - the first troll; spammed Egyptian Mario images in the catalog, one titled "fuck".

*[[User:MoronicTonic|Pooface]] - used a bot to spam images, and later filled 85 pages of swirled, mirrored, purple pictures of the same title and origin as Sheep's.
   *Phuck - Pooface alt #1.

*TinyTitties - Watched Pooface in a chatroom and joined in as a result. Spammed pictures of moobs.
