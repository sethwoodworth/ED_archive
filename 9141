'''Work''' was first brought to the masses by the cartoon strip ''[[Dilbert]]'', wherein it described a process whereby one performs voluntary services in exchange for [[money]]. Prior to the 1960s, "work" was generally referred to as "[[slavery]]."

All work managers are [[fat]], bald, miserable, [[white]] Protestant men because: 
* minorities [[poverty|don't]] or "[[disability|can't]]" [[welfare|work]];
* all [[atheist]]s are either friendless technical professionals or jabbering, [[homeless]] [[schizophrenic]]s (see: [[Gene Ray]]);
* the highest level to which a woman can aspire in a company is to that of [[bitch|Secretary]], a [[Bullshit|theoretical phenomenon]] known as the "glass ceiling".

[[Suicide|Ending ones work life]] is known as '''retirement'''. In the [[United States of America]], this usually entails a [[McDonald's|lard]]-induced [[heart attack]] for [[men]] and [[pregnancy]] for [[women]]. [[Feminazis]] have attempted to redefine household chores as work ("housework"), but since the advent of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica|post-modern irony]] they have since returned to the [[kitchen]] and put the tea on.
