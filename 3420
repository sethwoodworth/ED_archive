Google Seppuku
'''Google Seppuku''' is a "game" invented by [[webcomic]] artist Ghastly as a punishment for his children. He later posted a description of the game in his comic, to settle a bar bet over whether any of his readers were stupid enough to try it. Much to his surprise, the [[meme]] spread quickly, mostly among the incurably [[insane]] (who make up about 90% of the regulars on [[teh]] [[internets]]). 

The game is played by entering random combinations of Japanese characters into the [[Google#Google Images|Google Image Search tool]] and then scanning through the results until you find an image that makes you want to kill yourself. Given the perverse nature of the [[Japanese]], this rarely takes long.
