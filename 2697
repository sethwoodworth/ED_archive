Erectile dysfunction
[[image:The_Giver.jpg|thumb|right|“Erectile Dysfunction? Hah! Erectile dysfunction ''this''!”]]
Erectile dysfunction is when you can’t get it up even when there’s a [[asking for it|hot chick with her legs spread wide open in front of you]]. In other words you are no longer a man. If you tell your friends you have it they will laugh and abandon you so it’s probably best you keep it to yourself. Also, you should get ready for living the rest of your life alone. Your only realistic alternatives are to get experimental, dangerous surgery, join a religious [[cult]] requiring you to [[Catholic Church|take a vow of celibacy]] or start enjoying taking it [[in the ass]].

Erectile dysfunction has been known to be abbreviated as [[ED]]. Despite possible lulzy interpretations, most people who use the acronym ED IRL [[Lie|are not referring to this site]].
