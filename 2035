Daniel Peter "Hyde Hubbard Crowley" Masterson (born March 13, 1976 in Albertson, New York) is an American actor from [[Long Island]] best known for his role as a stoner on ''[[porn|That Shitty Show]]''. He also starred as Justin in Cybill, Jimmy in Roseanne, and has made several guest appearances on Punk'd and [[shit|MADtv]]. Dan is a co-owner of Dolce, a Scientology front restaurant he founded with That '70s Show co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama. 

Masterson also frequently DJs at Los Angeles night clubs under his name, DJ Donkey Punch / or DJ MOM JEANS. Masterson <s>also co-hosts a Monday night radio show titled Feel My [[Cock|Heat]], on [[Hipster|Indie 103.1]] in Los Angeles, which loves to be [[troll]]ed with requests for '''MORE''' [[Xenu]]</s> GOT FIRED!. As co-host of this show, he frequently displays a knack for perverted [[L. Ron Hubbard|L. RON JEREMY]] humor, as exemplified by a dialogue he once initiated concerning a canine's sex organs. He started out by musing on what a dog's vagina is officially referred to as, then continued for ten minutes longer, quizzing everyone in his studio as to what the official name for a dog's vagina could possibly be (despite the fact that everyone already knew there is no special term). He is currently dating the coke whore Bijou Phillips.

Master$on is a member of the so-called Church of [[cult|Scientology]]. In 2005 Hyde helped promote the gala opening of $cientology's controversial "Psychiatry: An Industry of Death" Museum, which puts forth a conspiracy theory connecting [[Adolf Hitler]] to the psychiatric profession. He frequently rails against psychiatry on-air, but is to date unwilling to discuss the beliefs of $cientology on-air because he is brainwashed not to.
