Some [[Attention whore|crazy-ass]] [[nigra]] with the unpronounceable name [[Muslim|"Nafiza Ziyad"]] [[chimpout|chimps out]] on an older, more civilized [[black]] woman.  Other [[Snakes On A Plane|apes on the train]] grow tired of her monkey antics and decide to [[fuck]] with her, taking her red hat and dew-rag.  [[Verbose|She then informs them that she plans to pursue legal action]] by yelling out loudly and repeatedly, '''IM PRESSIN CHARGES!!!'''

'''IM PRESSIN CHARGES''' is [[spam]]med all over the [[internet]] and a [[Original Content|meme]] is born.

==Warrant and Arrest==

Police in Atlanta’s public transportation have issued a warrant for the arrest of a young woman known as “Soulja Girl” after she was seen violently rebuking an elderly woman on a subway line. Evident of how low intellect niggers should NOT leave their ghetto after smoking crack and listening to Soulja Boy's noise. 

The black person was seen screaming on the train at the elderly woman while reciting lyrics to the rapper [[fag|Soulja Boy]]. The black person is seen on a widely-viewed video screaming, “Yaaa, black person, yaaa” and [[Threats of violence|“I’ma beat your ass on this train.”]] We are not making this up.

She also called the senior citizen a [[ho]] and a bitch and threatened to kill her.

Wanda Y. Dunham, the chief of police for Moving black person Rapidly Through [[Atlanta]] (MARTA), issued a statement requesting help in arresting the female.

A MARTA representative confirmed that the person in the video is indeed the same person sought by police.

“MARTA police were notified about this video last Friday and launched an immediate and aggressive investigation into the incident,” said Dunham said in a statement. “The tipster also indicated the suspect has been known to ride Bus Route 22. MARTA police were able to positively identify the individual allegedly involved in this incident and have secured a warrant for her arrest.”

The sensational event occurred at the East Lake Station, which is where the suspect exited the train after the female berated the elderly patron.

One of the men objecting to her actions on the train yanked at Soulja Girl’s weave after she accused him of raping her. Shortly thereafter, the aggressive female exited the train. Dunham attempted to quell any concerns for public safety.

“We want to assure the public that this is an extremely isolated incident and that customer safety and security are our highest priorities,” the MARTA Chief of Police said. “We regret that any customer had to endure such harassment while using our system. I also wish the many citizens who witnessed this incident would have contacted the MARTA police so that we could have responded to this situation immediately. We are asking that anyone who witnessed this incident please come forward to provide additional first hand information, which may lead to additional charges against the suspect.”

MARTA police urge customers and witnesses to help by calling the MARTA Police Detectives at (404) 848-4911

Captured by another rider the video of the woman's rant, directed at an elderly MARTA rider, has become an [[Meme|Internet sensation]], getting heavy viewing on [[YouTube]] and other Web video sites.

During the confrontation the young woman refers to herself as "Soulja Girl," repeatedly uses the N-word and threatens an elderly woman.

After getting tips identifying the young woman as Ziyad, MARTA police charged her with simple assault and two counts of disorderly conduct.

Investigators told WSB-TV Channel 2 reporter Tom Jones they were able to identify the elderly passenger and after speaking with her they arrested Ziyad. Her mother e-mailed WSB-TV's Monica Pearson and claimed Ziyad is bi-polar and was off her medication when the attack took place.

At first other passengers don't interfere during the minutes-long attack, but finally one man can be heard telling "Soulja Girl" to "chill." Instead of taking that advice she turns on the other passengers, accusing one of [[witchcraft|rape]] through invoking the writ of [[Cthulhu| YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH TRICK YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.]]

Eventually a male passenger confronts her and appears to knock her wig askew.

After repeatedly screaming "I'm pressing charges, I'm pressing charges," the woman exits the train.

After learning of the video MARTA police launched what they called "an immediate and aggressive investigation into the incident."

MARTA officials said they will work with the solicitor general's office to prosecute Ziyad to the fullest extent of the law.
