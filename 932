Bestiality Boy
Beastiality boy is on a level of [[Forced Meme]] like no other Advice Dog variation. It came about sometime in March 2009 when a poor misguided [[faggot]] came on /b/ looking for help because his RL "friends" were making fun of him and making [[furry]] claims about him, which he found unjust.

Suddenly, some faggot has this boys face pasted onto the advice dog generator (they didn't even change the background colors!) with even more bestiality claims, shoving this forced meme down /b/'s throat like a Milhouse on steroids.
