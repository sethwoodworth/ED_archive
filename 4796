The '''Legion of Doom''' ('''LOD''')  was a former band of [[haxor]]s and [[phreak]]s from the [[floppy disk]] era. Telecommunication companies perceived the LOD as a threat, since the LOD was uncovering their secretes and posting them. As a result, they sent a [[Operation Sundevil|taxpayer-sponsored hit squad]] to weed them out. Later, a major [[fallout]] between LOD members led to a split and the creation of the [[Masters of Deception]] (MOD). Eventually, the MOD gained the upper hand in the conflict. The group dissolved after conflicts with US authorities.
