'''Segacamp''', the King of [[asperger's syndrome|Asspies]], also known as [[Powerword|Michael Campbell]] is a [[autism|troubled]] [[Canadian]]. When he isn't 'sperging around at home, he enjoys making [[fail|a cappelas]], video game walkthroughs and [[Unwarranted Self-Importance|raging at people who tell him he's shit.]] According to his [http://www.youtube.com/user/MrSegacamp youtube channel] he is, amazingly, still single. [[DO NOT WANT|Ladies, this is your chance.]]


==The Beginning==
[[File:Sonicpicfb.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sonic and asspies go hand in hand]]
Somewhere around [[2007]] segacamp, after a performance infront of his parents, got the idea that he was a musical genius. Even though his parents just told him that he was good to be supportive, segacamp decided to share his gift with the world.

This is a typical [[Earrape|performance]] from Segacamp

Along his singing career he has butchered such classics as [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5F6wr_07Q0 Don't Stop Believing], [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyDEoSeKEN8 The Final Countdown] among many others.
[[obvious|For some reason]] people commented that he was [[Truth|infact]] very bad, which caused him to make this [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlUbUMshTPY&feature=player_embedded announcement], where he tells us he has had enough of his haters, [[BAWWW|and that THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF FREAKING POOPHEADS]]. Segacamp also tells us he is trying to enter Canadian Idol, this being around [[2007]].

==A New Dawn==
In [[2009]] segacamp decided to make a capellas. He somehow manages to be even worse at a capellas than he is at singing.

===A Challenger Appears===
A challenger appeared, known as [http://www.youtube.com/user/DruoxTheShredder DruoxTheShredder]. They would duel the way you duel on the internet, by having an a capella off. 

Segacamp's performance:

Druox's perfomance:
<center><youtube>wxCeqr9Bm84</youtube></center>
(go to 1:51 for his version)

Obviously segacamp lost, and as a result he raged. He raged hard, and to this day he is still pissed at Druox. [[Trolls|Historians]] claim that it was around this time segacamp was titled "The King Of Asspies".

==The King Of Asspies==
Segacamp was not pleased with his new title, nor the many people calling him an [[Aspie|asspie]], so he decided to rage harder. It only became worse for him when he won the annual [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0UB-h-r3ic ABW (Asspies Barley Wrestling)] Championship beating [[Chris-chan]] in the finale. 
Meanwhile Segacamp tries to play it [[Internet Tough Guy|tough]], and makes a video for his blogtv account wherein he threatens his youtube haters with shooting them in the head. He is very proud of the exact phrasing of his threat so he still uses it to this day.

==R.I.P. Kevin==
Kevin, segacamp's pet turtle, died around August 2010. Most [[Trolls|professionals]] support the theory that segacamp's turtle, despite being a turtle, commited suicide after segacamp's unbearable audio torture.

==Youtube Partner==
[[File:Starfail.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Segacamp displaying his powers]]
{{quote|I suggest you take me out of it I'm youtube Partnering now and I will make sure it will go straight down the shitter because [[ericDouglace|you do not know what I am capable of]] and I will do whatever it takes to make you have a very bad day|Segacamp and his powers of youtube partnership}}
[[srs_bsns|Recently segacamp announced he was now a youtube partner.]] Proud days for asspies everywhere. Later it was revealed he only had partnership on one video, and even so it was on an account now no longer his. Now as MrSegacamp, he claims yet again to have partnership [[Shit nobody cares about|but not a single fuck was given that day.]]

==[[Taking_down_ED|TAKE THIS SITE DOWN!]]==
[[File:Segathreat.PNG|right|thumb|400px|The guy that was going to take the page down for him turned out to be the guy who got his [[dox]], well played Segacamp.]]
<center><youtube>EFYaN5yd0SA</youtube></center>
Segacamp discovered his ED page after constantly searching his own name on google. He then asked all his [[trolls|fans]] from [[facebook]] and [[youtube]] to help him in an attempt to stop the [[truth]] from being revealed. He also claims that he does not have a brother, only a little sister that does not [[Pwned|wish to be associated with him on youtube]]. Seeing how the theory of his turtle's death was stupid, he then proceeds to tell us that the reason his turtle died was because he was too much of a [[lazy]] fuck to clean the turtle tank, and it eventually died. Letting it go by as turtle suicide would have been way more acceptable than his own cruel explanation.

===Response===
Segacamp couldn't handle the truth being put out on [[ED]], he decided to retaliate, and make his own wikipedia page. But what happened instead, because he's [[Stupid|extremely unintelligent]], was that he created a user, and then wrote about himself ''on his user talk page''. Not even his user page, he decided it would be best put on his talk page.{{Bigpic|Wiki2.PNG|1000|600|}}
Obviously he wrote this with only one hand, [[Masturbation|if you know what I'm saying.]] Notice the [http://sonichu.com/cwcki/Chris_and_English#Written_language CWC-isms in his writing.] He then realized it was all wrong, and meanwhilst he was blocked from editing.

[[Image:SegaBlocked.PNG|800px]]

Seeing that no one would do shit for him, Segacamp decided to make a few of the displayed videos on [[ED]] private, but seeing how they were saved it didn't really make a difference, and instead a far more humiliating performance was put up.

==The 2nd Annual ABW Tournament==
ABW 2011 was announced, and Segacamp being last years champion was eager to express his opinions on ABW 2011 only a few days after the announcement was made.
{{quote|I'm gonna take down this whole series, right down, collapse the whole thing, BURN it to the ground, untill... untill no one um uhmu even um uhmu untill everyone stops this ridiculous charade of me being an [[asspie]].|Segacamp, obviously being an asspie}}
<center><youtube>zJE_WuoN8JI</youtube></center>
More rage is hoped to come as the second edition of the tournament launches.

==Segacamp finds a boyfriend-free girl==
[[Image:Missmonkeyandsegacamp.PNG|center|200px|The happy couple]]
[[File:Penissega.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gazing into your soul]]
[[File:Segashirtless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Jesus christ what is that behind him?]]]]
On [[Shit Nobody Cares About|12/1/2010]] an unexpected [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ5eT4lN0-I announcement] was made, segacamp found a girl desperate enough to be associated with him. This was good news, since segacamp had thought about closing his youtube account, stopping the [[lulz]]. His lady, Miss Monkey, is without a doubt a tremendous achievement for segacamp on his venture into adulthood, now he just needs to throw out the toys under his bed.

Their relationship turned out to be a shortlived one, and after [[hacking]] into MissMonkey's computer lots of goodies were released, including audio recordings that contained him having [[Rule 34|Mario and Peach pretend sex]] with MissMonkey.

==New Partnership on Youtube==
To protect himself from [[trolls]] and haters, he went to an old friend, also known as [[Gamelife|Geoff The Hero]]. Geoff has indeed helped him in the war against trolls and haters, by uploading lots of irrelevant videos on his channel. Segacamp will go on with his regular asspieing, despite sharing his youtube account with someone else. This is another great example of how naïve Segacamp is, and not being able to tell he's being trolled. The partnership has finally come to an end, [[irony|only foreseers could have seen that come]].

==MrKrampenDamp confronts Segacamp==
[[Last Thursday]] [http://www.youtube.com/user/MrKrampenDamp MrKrampenDamp], [[Troll|an logical analyst]] told the world about his deep analysis of the [[asspie]] phenomenon segacamp.
Then he asked segacamp for some promotion in response to his video, which segacamp was not amused by. Segacamp replied back in anger, whereafter MrKrampenDamp told segacamp that if he didn't do as he say, he'd notify everyone about segacamp's newly arrived penis picture on ED. Segacamp suddenly changed his tone and a deal was made after some dramatic pressure from MrKrampenDamp, which finally resulted in a very angry shoutout video to MrKrampenDamp, and his good [[no homo|joyboy]] Vorph, the creator of this page:

<center><youtube>LYShVEGEGrs</youtube></center>
He then made a second shoutout video on his new channel, also announcing the new alliance between Segacamp, MrKrampenDamp and Vorph, and good times were had.

==New Account==
After Segacamp decided to give his password out to several people, it got closed. Luckily a great person managed to get ahold of it and give it back to segacamp, only to have segacamp fuck it up and accidently close the account again. He is now back on [[Jewtube]] to please his massive european fanbase as MrSegacamp, which is a more manly name anyways according to Segacamp.
