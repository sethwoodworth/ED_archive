[[ED Sysops|The Few, The Proud, The Brave]]. The following is a list of ED's finest who are missing in action. Some left with nary a [[kthxbye|farewell]], others just fell off [[ED:Map|the map]]...all are missed.

*'''[[Blu Aardvark]]''' - Eaten to death by his own [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.lifestyle.furry/browse_thread/thread/8e2900498ed039b2/eaae4a6b96a72895?lnk=raot specially bred sporting dogs].
*'''[[User:Theburk|BURK]]''' - Voted off the island by the [[EDF]] and was [[g-line]]d by [[Weev]] as a result. He is now stuck on [[Facebook]] posting misspelled [[emo]] rants and [[hipster]] prints.
*'''[[User:Chunkmunky|Chunkmunky]]''' and '''[[User:Crazyconan|Crazyconan]]''' - One too many [[Dancing Sandwich]]es. Though Crazyconan's a [[13 year-old boy|kid]]...
*'''[[User:Endedrural|Endedrural]]''' - ED’s own rainbow yoshi. He was sacrificed after jumping off a cliff in order for Mario to reach the other side.
*'''[[User:Finney|Finney]]''' - Rumored to have found her [[Dyke|perfect woman]].
*'''[[Ghostlight]]''' - Purported to have gotten lost in his LiveJournal inbox buried under messages.
*'''[[User:IckleBee|IckleBee]]''' - Known as the Godfather of the deviantART articles of ED.
*'''[[Jawsome]]''' - Unfortunately entered into a [[Friend Zone|healthy relationship]] and possibly graduated from [[Art School]].

*'''[[User:Paco650|Paco]]''' - ED's token [[Beaner]], Paco went back to Mexico to get a decent job after the [[bailout plan|US economy took a crap]].
*'''[[User:Pierced|Pierced]]''' - Entered a wormhole in ''[[EVE Online]]'', possibly stuck.
*'''[[Quasidan]]''' - ED's token Jew never returned from Yom Kippur where he was asked to atone for [[Quasidan's penis|his contributions to ED]].
*'''[[Riboflavin|Ribo]]''' - Thought to be in [[Gitmo]] after being mistaken for [[Cho Seung Hui]] on the [[Virginia Tech]] campus.

This troll of trolls simply vanished into the ether in late [[2007]] after -rumour has it- [[christfag|finding God]].
*'''[[Yiri]]''' - supposedly in an [[australia]]n jail; this is an obvious lie by the government in order to cover the fact that he decimated the squad they sent to arrest him with his knife and vanished
*'''[[User:Zenophile808|Zenophile]]''' - Turned out to be The Final Boss of [[Chanology]], vanished without trace when [[Anon]]'s forces were overrun by [[moralfag]]s. Thought to be [[Agent Pubeit]].
