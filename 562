'''Antonie Dixon''' was a [[meth]]-addled bogan [[redneck]] from West Auckland, who [[Fail|failed]] to become [[an hero]] after a two week long rampage across [[New Zealand]] in 2003 that culminated in him attacking and cutting off the hands of his [[Girlfriend|ex-girlfriend]] and her friend with a [[Weeaboo|Samurai sword.]]. He later [[an hero|an hero'd]] successfully, becoming a pioneer researcher in the field of the [[Streetfighter|E. Honda]] method of an heroing.

== Family life ==
Dixon was raised in a boarding house by a [[Mormon|strict and fanatical]] mother who [[raep|did her best]] to teach little Antonie to be a good boy, but as a teenager, he quickly gravitated towards a life of [[Theft|crime]] and [[Gang|gang violence]].

Despite outward appearances, Dixon was [[meth|not at all high on P]] during his rampage - indeed, the entire episode can be explained by the [[Buttsecks|intimate]] relationship that Dixon developed with a [[Satan|goblin]] and his entourage of cackling gremlins:

== Failed to become internets sensation ==
Dixon's rampage caused widespread shock and outrage to a [[New Zealand]] public more used to garden variety domestic violence and child abuse. It was not until his initial court appearance that the true lulz of the situation became clear, as the widely published photos of Dixon's [[insane]] haircut and stare in the dock became subject of a surge in email traffic as bored fucktards and bureaucrats were unable to resist the temptation of finger pointing and laughing. Use of a samurai sword may also have contributed to lowering the "give a fuck" factor of popular perceptions towards this crime. For an entire generation of Kiwi [[lusers]], Dixon's face became synonymous with [[meth]] abuse, yet statistics indicate that this may have led to an increase in overall drug use during this time period, although the more obvious explanation is that [[New Zealand]] has become a nation of crackhead epsilon semi-morons, and Dixon's insanity was just a drop in the ocean of more widespread [[fail]].

== An heroation ==
Despite his numerous shortcomings as a human being, in death he has become an influential figure in New Zealands suicide industry. On the 5th of February, the morning he was to be sentenced, Dixon was assessed by a psychiatrist who found him to be at risk of suicide. He was isolated and put under suicide watch, where [[Epic_win|HE FUCKING COMMITTED SUICIDE ANYWAY]]. Media reports are sketchy, but it seems that he ended his pathetic excuse for a life by flinging himself head-first at a wall. Dixon has become a beacon of light to an heroes everywhere, proving that not even incarceration, psychiatric assistance, being on suicide watch and a complete lack of suicide implements can stop a truly determined failure.

== Legacy ==

Antoine Dixon is now a folk-hero in New Zealand, whose life story is told to the young to remind them that if they fail really hard, they might just win.
