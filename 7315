Scroll up
'''Scroll up''' is shorthand for "You're a fucking idiot for just jumping into the conversation when all you had to do is read the last ten lines or so.  Honestly.  If you can't deal with a text based communication medium go back to AOL.  LOL."

It's commonly used on [[IRC]] where you can actually scroll up (unless you use [[irssi]] in which case scrolling up is far too much work).  It should be used in other situations where it's not [[relevant]] for comedic effect.  In fact, you should start doing that ''right now''.

[[Irony|Ironically]], you will never have to scroll up on this page.
