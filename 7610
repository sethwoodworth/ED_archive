Snapesnogger> if i RP with anyone, they will just say VEs is a wimp etc.
Snapesnogger> and dee will get depressed.
Akumyo> Maybe pull out a different character?
Snapesnogger> so i end up having little to no fun because of it.
Akumyo> Aw
Dee> I don't like my other characters
SatouGaki> I...want to punch this one girl I used to RP with cause of that dumb shit.
Dee> They're all underdeveloped anyways.
Akumyo> It's no big deal, we all have our bad days.
Snapesnogger> but it means you wont RP with me.
Snapesnogger> but cos dees got crom
SatouGaki> yeauh what Akumyo said
Snapesnogger> and he's sooooooo much better
Dee> Sigh.
</pre>
<pre>
SatouGaki> that ain't what a friend does.
GunoSaguki> Snapesnogger, although I probably don't understand the situation entirely, 
my advice would be to avoid looking at the downside of things.
Snapesnogger> i don't know how she feels!
Snapesnogger> she never tells me straight answers!
Snapesnogger> how can I ever know?
Akumyo> I don't think Dee is trying to do anything personal, she just wants to RP with 
other people occasionally.
Dee> I've said plenty of times how I feel.
SatouGaki> well yeauh because Dee doesn't speak up enough?
Dee> But they are constantly looked over.
Snapesnogger> i dont know what to say or how to say what i feel without upsetting you
Snapesnogger> cos you just go all quiet.
Snapesnogger> i feel so useless.
Snapesnogger> like im a shitty friend.
(long pause)
Dee> I get quiet whenever I don't want to offend.
reirei> me too

SatouGaki> You...always are, damn thing must be dried up by now.
Snapesnogger> i casnt help it

Snapesnogger> i just dont want to feel like a pointless blob to you all.
Snapesnogger> which i always do
SatouGaki> Your...not helping your situation much.
Snapesnogger> do you think i like feeling sad?
GunoSaguki> Snapesnogger, im going a little "eh" with this but...this is the internet.

Snapesnogger> it would be so much better
SatouGaki> Understand what exactly?
Snapesnogger> but i keep getting caught up in flurries of emotion.
GunoSaguki> Im goign to Side with Satou on that statement. Just Relax and chat, 
draw, or whatever. if you discuss these things so much itll just-
Snapesnogger> your not me, so you cant understand how much pain i feel.
SatouGaki> Your sad? Because your being selfish because someones fictional character

Snapesnogger>THTAS NOT IT
SatouGaki> Then what is it?

*kauritsuo entered Niko's Paintchat.*
GunoSaguki> Snapesnogger...not Everyone in the world can understand one another.
its like Artwork.
SatouGaki> Uh...same here?
GunoSaguki> Some people can't see the idelastic views hidden behind the surface, even 
if you try to explain it.
SatouGaki> I don't think differently of my friends because i can only communicate by text.
SatouGaki> there still people behind those words.
Snapesnogger> satou please stop pikcing my words apart please!
Snapesnogger> i know! but its so hard to get your feelings across
Snapesnogger> without offending everyone!
Snapesnogger> people on the internet are the only people i can talk to.
Snapesnogger> but im apparently not allowed to talk about anything with them.
GunoSaguki> I myself, tend to hold n my feelings. don't tell your feelings unless you feel 
you can trust the people wont be mean about it.
SatouGaki> And yet you shoot them down and tell them they dont understand?
Snapesnogger> satou im trying really hard here!!!
Snapesnogger> I REALLY AM
SatouGaki> Trying hard to do...? What?
SatouGaki> What are you trying to accomplish?
Snapesnogger> how can i trust anyone
Snapesnogger> im trying to explain myself
Snapesnogger> and you keep puhsing me bvack!
SatouGaki> Okay then I'll just shut the fuck up
GunoSaguki> Sato is, but thats one person. you just have to find the people that won't.
GunoSaguki> no guarantee itll be easy or hard to find those people though.
Snapesnogger> i know im an awful person
Snapesnogger> it seems people want me to hate myself even more
SatouGaki> LULZ
Snapesnogger> noone ever says anything encouraging to me
GunoSaguki> I don't
Snapesnogger> its always "stop being patheitc"
Snapesnogger> or soemthing like that.
kauritsuo> I dont think I've ever said anything like that to you Snapesnogger...
Snapesnogger> not you kauri
GunoSaguki> I never say things like that unless said person personally offended a friend 
of mine.
Snapesnogger> when im stupid enough to tell the world how i feel...
Snapesnogger> and people cant handle me
Snapesnogger> and i get angry.
Dee> Kauri constantly is complimenting you.
Snapesnogger> dee? are you still there?
Dee> it kinna seems like you push her away.
SatouGaki> Oh IVE BEEN THROUGH THIS DEE.
Snapesnogger> no i dont!!!
SatouGaki> Dont go thar!
Dee> mmkay, fine fine
Snapesnogger> i love kauri
Snapesnogger> and i appreciate her support when shes here.
Dee> Yet you say everyone shuts you down.
Snapesnogger> i just wish i knew a way to stop hating myself.
Snapesnogger> i dont mean literally everyone
Snapesnogger> but alot of people do
Snapesnogger> this is my problem
Snapesnogger> and im sorry for bringing everyone into it.
SatouGaki> Okay, because you hate yourself, you automatically assume everyone else
hates you? Way to go, your an all-star.
Snapesnogger> i dont know how
Snapesnogger> i need help
SatouGaki> And not bring it into a place where people all have their own problems. But 
usually keep quiet about them.
Dee> I try to constantly hide my problems so others won't have to worry about them.
Snapesnogger> Why?
Snapesnogger> i would try to help
Dee> Because people get annoyed with people who whine about problems.
Snapesnogger> i dont understnad
Dee> So I don't bother with it.
GunoSaguki> The same goes for me Dee. although, when it comes to PHYSICAL problems. 
i can whine a lot ((such as back pains, heh XD))
Snapesnogger> i wouldnt whine at you for it
Dee> I know, but I've always been an introverted person.
Snapesnogger> i would tell you "it will be okay, im here" or something.
Dee> I don't like to throw myself out there.
Snapesnogger> It seems everyone but me is...
Dee> I don't need that kind of support.
Snapesnogger> am i a freak for being the way i am?
SatouGaki> Aye, I have my problems to, I dont lunge myself out spewing my problems 
because OH! I'm considerate!
Dee> I need to think level-headed and solve problems.
Dee> Rather than rant them to others.
GunoSaguki> Ves, your not a freak. you just are more open with your feelings than you need
to be.
Snapesnogger> am i?
Snapesnogger> i dont knwo how to stop it.
Snapesnogger>i just want some love.
Dee> You're extremely extroverted and that's not really the norm. That's why people have 
such a hard time adjusting to it.
SatouGaki> Go find your fanbase?
GenoSaguki> If there is a way, itd be to find something to discuss. when it comes to feelings, 
i can be happy if theres something to discuss.
Snapesnogger> thats not funny satou
Dee> You look too deep into things.
Dee> Almost like you search for ways that a sentence can insult you.
Snapesnogger> its because im used to it.
Dee> Just know that people are different.
Snapesnogger> Its like i feel that everyone will ned up hating me anyway, so i better push 
them that direction before it hurts me too much.
Snapesnogger> does that make any sense?
Dee> They don't understand things the same way you do.
Dee> I understand that.
Dee> I'm trying to tell you that it's not always the case.
GunoSaguki> No Snapesnogger. if you do that, your just guaranteeing theyll hate you.
Snapesnogger> i used to get bullied at school and now i get bullied by 4chan.
Snapesnogger> its better if i know they hate me than to constantly have mental battles 
with myself.
kauritsuo> Okay, so your bullied, but how old were you when you got bullied at school?... 
and how old are you now...?
GunoSaguki> Ive had both similar situations ((although, not 4chan, just on a forum once)). 
its better you try and ignore those people.
Dee> Wait.
Snapesnogger> because alot of my so called friends in the past
Dee> If you say you don't want us to hate you
Dee> What is the -point- in driving us that way?
Snapesnogger> Just, lied to me.
Snapesnogger> i dont know
Snapesnogger> i just dont know.
SatouGaki> Brilliant!
SatouGaki> Immah go get a pop and a few aspirin brb.
Dee> Then what are we supposed to do?
GunoSaguki> when it comes to 4chan actually, i get annoyed. people with bad artistic 
ability often dislike those who are noticably better.
Dee> You say you want empathy but it comes across as insults.
Snapesnogger> dee im so mixed up.
Snapesnogger> you said that everyone is different and i have to understand that
Snapesnogger> then why cant anyone open their minds for me
Belial> Dee, your logic has no place here!
GunoSaguki> Honestly, when it comes to jerks, i think of one thing "American" cause in 
my mind, a steryotypical american nowadays thats considered "Cool" by society 
is a big jerk!
Dee> Well, they're not gonna change if you don't change with them.
Snapesnogger> so i have to be like everyone else?
Dee> No.
kauritsuo> No, you don't you can be who you wanna be.
GunoSaguki> I can open up my mind to many people. it all just depends on what the 
thing is being discussed.
Snapesnogger> no i cant
Snapesnogger> cos i upset everyone
Dee> I'm just saying. Open your mind to people who want to hear it.
Snapesnogger> The way that i am
Dee> Rather than try to force it on people who obviously don't want to deal with it.
Snapesnogger> how am i supposed to know.
GunoSaguki> Hell, the majority of people in the world think they do. and thats why they 
ruin their lives ((those who think smoking makes them cool and such))
kauritsuo> You only upset people because you make yourself upset and that affects 
everyone involved with you.
Dee> They will ask you if they're concerned.
Snapesnogger> your my best friend, but i cant confide in you cos you dont like it.
Snapesnogger> i cant confide in my mum cos im scared shell shout at me
Dee> I didn't say that.
Belial> y'know...if you KNOW you make people dislike you...there's nothing wrong 
with changing who you are
Snapesnogger> no i mean
Snapesnogger> i feel guilty
Belial> if yer unhappy with it
Snapesnogger> i dont know why everyones perfect except for me
Snapesnogger> why did i have to be born a freak
kauritsuo> Okay okay...
Akumyo> Hahahahaha!
kauritsuo> No one is perfecg
GunoSaguki> i'm not perfect Ves
Belial> cuz...coing in here and acting like an ass, isn't helping yourself make friends
DarkGrey> I hope thats sarcasm
GunoSaguki> hell, aparently, i have this thing called "Aspers Syndrome"
Snapesnogger> IM NOT DOING IT ON PURPOSE
Dee> It counts against you too.
kauritsuo> I have a learning dissability for god's sake.
GunoSaguki> ist this Crap-ass term or w/e that people label on those who don't care 
about things that are popular or w/e.
Belial> it's really simple to think before you speak.
Snapesnogger> but
Snapesnogger> i want people to know how i feel.
Snapesnogger> cos im tired of having to bottle everything up
Dee> Well screaming at them doesn't help.
kauritsuo> Then tell them.
SatouGaki> Sadly we do now.
GunoSaguki> Not everyone will understand Snapesnogger.
kauritsuo> The people who are your friends, and you KNOW who they are, will NEVER 
judge you for your problems in life, cuz thats LIFE.
Snapesnogger> do i have any good points?
Snapesnogger> cos i cant see them.
SatouGaki> Yes because 1. Im quite a bitch at this point. 2. Go refer to number 1 for anything.
kauritsuo> And some of your friends mey NOT understand fully, but if theu;re given 
the chance they'll wanna understand.
Belial> >:D
GunoSaguki> In personality. id have to be that you aren't afraid of opening up and 
others are being jerks because they are unaccustomed to it.
Dee> Hey Belial
Snapesnogger> nu not bel.
GunoSaguki> i myself am AFRAID of opening up.
Snapesnogger> hes just going to make it worse and insult me some more.
kauritsuo> Everyone is.
Belial> Oh yes, BEL! >:D
Snapesnogger> like that fucking helps.
Belial> cuz i'm an asshole!
kauritsuo> I know I have some things about me because it'll take a VERY SPECIAL 
person to understand...
Snapesnogger> just please dont say anything mean to me please.
Dee> Bel has a sense of humor.
Dee> I like that.
Snapesnogger> Do i have any nice points?
Belial> That's like telling me not to talk! XD
GunoSaguki> Youll know if their your friend if they dont insult you or make fun of you 
for the way they are.
Dee> You do, Snapesnogger.
Snapesnogger> i think.
GunoSaguki> I can tell she is.
Dee> Its just hard to see them.
Dee> g'night all you happy and not so happy peoples.
*Dee leaves.*
