Lamp
{{Forced Meme}}

Lamp was the [[frosted butts]] of [[2008]]. If you end a post with Lamp, you're a [[faggot]]. This is scientifically proven, so don't even try to argue with it.

==FUCK YOU LAMP!==

[[Some argue|Some believe]] that this is a form of [[cancer]] that is killing /b/, however some are claiming that this is in fact a clever form of [[chemo]] - generally people who believe this are  [[retards|uninformed about the present situation]].

==Antidote?==

For now, it looks as if the seemingly malignant lamp cancer is gone, and the remaining posts are just fags trying to perpetuate it as a meme. In a thread [[GÎ¿rdon the Pringles Giraffe|Gordon]] decided to act against it and fought off some of the very bad parts of this disgusting lump of fail.

Currently this failure is rumored to have started from a Java script worm, with typical [[newfags]] mistaking it for a meme, and with the cancerous tumor eventually experiencing rapid accelerated growth due to lamp being the 97 million [[GET]].  Subsequent to the get, using the word lamp will now result in a ban.
