LiveJournal Buyout

After rumors began circulating that [[LiveJournal]] was being bought out by Movable Type-creator [[Six Apart]], it quickly became an [[old meme]] for people to post in their journals that [[Oh noes|OH NOEZ]] [[teh|TEH]] SKY IS FALLING LIVEJOURNAL HAS [[sellout|SOLD OUT]]!!!

These people apparently didn't realize the benefit of vastly increased stability and development resources that would come from the tripled resource pool of a combined Six Apart/LiveJournal effort, not to mention some of the less obvious benefits like increased staff salaries. With the [[LJ Abuse]] team getting paid more, they'll finally be able to afford some decent looking hookers and a weekly 8ball of blow. After getting laid and snorting a fat line, they'll undoubtedly be less of a bunch of vapid tightasses, and with less tightassery from the Abuse team, fewer [[LiveJournal]] [[Internet celebrities|superstars]] will get suspended.

Not only that, but [[Six Apart]] + [[LiveJournal]] = [[SALJ]]. This omen heralds the triumph of the [[SALJers]] over the [[Internets]].

For [[LJ user|users]], the first effect of the buyout was changes to the [[LJ TOS|Terms of Service]].

The second effect was opening the service to users younger than 13, plunging the average user age precipitously within weeks. [[Troll]] and [[Paraphilia|sexual deviant]] targets immediately changed from [[angst]]y [[teenager|teen]] [[mall]] [[goths]] to the pre-pubescent whine set.  Barbies and Hot-Wheels overtook [[IPOD|iPods]] on [[camwhore]] [[wishlist|wishlists]], and [[Ed Rodriguez|perverts]] gained an interest in early developing eight-year olds.

It remains to be seen whether this was LiveJournal's [[Jumped_the_shark|shark jumping]] moment, though the second LJ buyout by [[The Great LiveJournal Buyout of 2007|TEH RUSSIANS OMGZ]] will qualify if nothing else does.
