Excuse me wtf r u doin

Many wiki editors (On ED especially) do things that do not always have a clear purpose or motive to those who are not paying attention.  It could range from taking a seemingly inconspicuous picture out of an article or blanking some [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|obscure article that nobody reads and is not offensive.]]  Some will simply think nothing of it.  These people are blind and/or lazy, as there is always a [[Butthurt|hidden motive for everything]].  When curiousity gets the best of us, we feel compelled to inquire <b>"Excuse me [[wtf]] r u doin?"</b> - or perhaps some variation of the phrase.
