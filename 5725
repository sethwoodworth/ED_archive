New Mexico
[[Image:blank.jpg|thumb|Typical scenery in New Mexico]]
'''New Mexico''' (aka [[oxymoron|Good Mexico]]) is a [[cancer|nuclear]] dumping ground located somewhere between [[California|Failafornia]] and [[Texas|Texass]]. There is absolutely nothing there except for Albuquerque, [[Native Americans|Injuns]], [[Beaners]], and an occasional [[alien]] or two. People call it ''New'' Mexico because all the uranium in the ground makes it shine like a new penny, and because OLD [[Mexico]] didn't want it anymore.

== History ==
[[Image:Shitty_New_Mexico_Map_Description.jpg|thumb|Looking for shit in NM? Find it here.]]

[[At least 100 years ago]] some Indians (feather, not [[India|dot]]) who thought Mexico wasn't hot and dry enough, got lost and wound up in New Mexico. They started being driven out due to a lack of [[lulz]] and an influx of [[white people]], which eventually led to the [[alcoholism|Pueblo Revolt]]. Then [[9/11|later]] the Mexicans came and started [[war]] with the whites, claiming to have "[[I did it for the lulz|hecho le para los lulz]]." The Mexicans let the Indians back in, and they started casinos. [[Last Thursday]], the [[rednecks|white people]] moved back to make [[meth]] and retirement communities. Oh, and of course the [[Scientology|Scilon bunker]] with the weird crop circles is supposedly not existing somewhere beyond the mountains in the North, but no one cares since there's a whole town that worships [[Xenu]] in the South.

[[tl;dr]] - There was nothing then, there is nothing now.

== New Mexico Today ==

Being one of the few states not horribly effected by the recent recession, either because you can't [[win|bailout]] a ship that's been [[fail|sinking]] for decades, or because there are enough resources to be semi-sufficient in surviving without the rest of [[Dumbfuckistan|America]], [[Texas|their neighbors]] continue to see a need to [[troll]] by raising the cost of living by doing asshole things like driving into the state. Literally, just passing over the border costs the state somewhere along [[At least 100|$54]] a person, and that's not including them coming to [[cum|blow their wad]] at Indian casinos and STILL buying up land and vacation homes for their [[white|privileged, oil-rich selves]].[[Image:Dead hooker plan.jpg|thumb|left|Bury them in a shallow grave, that's what!]] If the insult wasn't the injury, [[Comcast]] and Qwest, in their ever-loving wisdom and [[h8]] of places with no money, have decided to make the state's internets power level nil. [[Apples Bear|Polar bears]] in [[Alaska]] and nigra on stolen computers in [[Louisiana|Atlantis]] can access their [[child porn|MySpace friends]] faster than a speeding [[Obama|Kenyan]], but the desert must continue to suck on Comcast's digital dick waiting [[over 9000]] hours for their Demonoid files to work from the [[College|New Mexico State University]] servers.

On the subject of state colleges, they [[LOL|BOTH SUCK]]. Fortunately they have [[GTFO|voted out]] [[at_least_100|almost everyone]] from the [[Jews|Administration]] and a few even had to pay their [[Jew gold|money]] back to the schools. Most American students are already dirt-poor in general, but New Mexico [[raep|takes it to the hole]] with their major loans consisting of the state lottery, Pell grants, FAFSA, FEMA, etc. If not for ''Terminator: Salvation'', or any other movie needing a desert scene, being [[forced meme|forced]] to use local students, the local [[hookers and blow|burlesque]] shows bringing in some meager wads of [[money|lucre]] to community and state colleges, and also a [[erection|huge rise]] in medical studies on new [[AIDS|doomsday virii]], the only things that would be left to fund would be [[football]] from two failure teams and the [[Hillary Clinton|open-close]] [[Obama|political speeches]] of [[Last Thursday|yester-year]].

There was also [[LOL WUT|another]] nationally-known hooker-killing spree: [http://www.koat.com/news/18812991/detail.html] [http://www.koat.com/news/18840232/detail.html][http://www.koat.com/video/18838573/index.html It's even a great time to test new technology,] [http://www.koat.com/news/18838544/detail.html After all, it's not like they're going anywhere, lulz]

New Mexico is also notorious for Governor Bill Richardson's desperate attempts to make the state technologically and economically relevant; usually this involves throwing money at companies with retardedly optimistic business plans. The companies, notably Eclipse Aviation and Tesla Motors, eventually die or pack up and leave without having sold [[Nothing of value was lost|enough products to make up for the ridiculous tax breaks the state gave them to set up shop there in the first place]].

State-funded attempts to bring 1950s technology (the commuter train between Albuquerque and the capital goes about 50mph and nobody rides it except for teenagers and old people) to the state are just as financially disastrous, except that since they use tax money they can continue to lose millions for the state for [[Forever|as long as the government cares to keep them running]].

== Good Things About New Mexico ==
*It's not [[Texas]]
*[[Buzzkill|A-Bomb]]
*[[Poor|Cheap as fuck houses.]]
*[[Irony|Most of the beaners are not illegal.]]
*[[LOL|Can drive alone at fucking 15 and a half.]]
*[[Drunk|Can drive fucking fast, and extremely well, at all times of the day and night.]]
*All the [[Shota|Boy Scouts]] go to [[Lolcano|Boy Scout Mountain]] or [[Goatse|Elephant Butte]] during the Summer so we don't have to put up with their [[faggotry|shit]].
*[[Bullshit|It doesn't rain, period.]]
*[[Bum|Pick up a nice homeless girl,]] [[Las Vegas|then drop her off in any shallow grave as you see fit.]]

== Bad Things About New Mexico ==
*[[Fallout|Radiation]]
*[[Drunk|Too many injuns.]]
*[[Mexican|Too many beaners.]]
*[[Fag|Too many fags.]]
*[[Hippie|Too many hippies]].
*[[Lame|Not enough niggers to whip the shit out of]], but that's not suggesting you should [[fail|try]] in [[Nigra|Hobbs]] or [[Martin Luther King|a certain scary street of the ABQ]].
*Not enough [[Asians]] to do your homework for you, thus [[Retard|bringing down the average]]. Worst still, the Yellows in the state are mostly in the [[Crips|Triad]].
*For the people who live there, they have to put up with [[fags|Boy Scouts]] in the Summer. Some lulz gained when the fat shits wearing $300 "hiking" boots and carrying $500 in survival gear get [[lost]].
*Almost as fail as [[Kansas]] for being LANDLOCKED and still having [[Katrina|hurricanes]] and [[Meatspin|tornadoes]] turning most of the state into [[Atlantis]]. [http://kob.com/article/stories/S524898.shtml?cat=500 See for yourself]

== Cities of New Mexico ==
[[Image:Hot-Air-Balloons.jpg|thumb|We gots em.]]
*<font size=4>[[Fail|Albuquerque]]</font size>, expensive as hell to live in despite being full of assholes and a [[Los Angeles|HUEG crime rate]]. The [[Police|C.O.P.S.]] TV series is banned from filming there because they always ran out of film. Has a [[ghey|mighty fine]] mixture of music scenes which comes in three flavors: [[Hardcore]] punk [[wigger|"gangs"]] [[IDIFTL|wanting to beat the shit out of each other for no reason]]; [[Indie]]-ass trust-fund [[Hipsters]] choking on the dick of Nob Hill while waiting for [[Lady GaGa|some nameless poker-face of an artist]] to come through town; and finally, [[Ghost Riding|Hip-Hop retarded]] minorities ([[White]] being the biggest) riding around town with ridiculous bass speakers and walking up and down Central like the scum of the Earth they usually are between bars and the paid parking spot they left their ugly Scion in. People from the rest of the state flock here looking for [[buttsex|acceptance]] and a decent [[college]]/[[job]], but end up being [[welfare]] problems, homeless, or a selfish prick.

*<font size=4>[[Oil|Artesia]]</font size>, houses an oil refinery that makes most of the surrounding area stink of shit and rotten eggs, and the only giant [[pr0n]] shop for [[at least 100|at least a couple hundred miles]].

*<font size=4>[[Goatse|Carlsbad]]</font size>, built around a giant hole in the ground atop mountains that are going to cave in (lol pun) one day. And yet, they have all the fun shit like a functional skate-park and nice stores, thanks to [[W|community funds and federal tourism]]. If you can't make the 3-4 hours to Albuquerque and live in the South/Southeast, this is usually your [[abortion|Plan B]].

*<font size=4>[[Ghetto|Clovis]]</font size>, a [[fail|bustling]] community in the east, known for its distinctive [[shit|aroma]] and black person of [[Last Thursday|yesteryear]]. Has an airforce base that almost got closed down, but the people living there said [[NO U]] to the thought of becoming Roswell 2.0, and [[blowjob|begged Massa Bush]] not to kill their livelihood.

*<font size=4>[[No Homo|Farmington]]</font size>, a small town near the [[The Power 5|Four Corners]] area that is fully supportive of [[bullshit|gay rights, black people, pre-maritial sex, Satanism, being a furry, or whatever else your heart desires]]. This [[Lynching|open attitude]] towards humanity is in no short thanks to their traditional [[Mormon]] values and the [[KKK|hard work of the community to support all sexes, creeds, and ways of life]]. If New Mexico was 4chan, this would probably be considered /b/ during the Summertime.

*<font size=4>[[Habbo|Hobbs]]</font size>, [[Nigra]] EVERYWHERE, oh lawd! Has a lot of [[Pool's Closed|pools]] for people who obv. can't swim. Also may have more Mexicans than Mexico; probably more Mexicans than Nigras.

*<font size=4>[[Bro|Las Cruces]]</font size>, has the biggest concentration of [[poser|posers]] and [[Bro|white-hat wearing fans of Asteroth and date-raep]] in the state. The college is also one of the hardest to both pass and get into, [[LOL WUT|so it makes no sense]]. Its chief exports are [[herpes]], future [[Pregnant_loli|teenage mothers]], and [[abortions]]. Oh, and Warped Tour once a year, [[fact|but that's basically the same thing]].

*<font size=4>[[Suburb|Rio Rancho]]</font size>, where the [[white people]] go before the sun sets in Albuquerque. Well, that is of course barring one of their two [[retard|giant dirt roads]] hasn't been washed out by rain, snow, wind, shit, etc., in which case [[rape|someone's gonna get raped]].

*<font size=4>[[UFO|Roswell]]</font size>, when in Roswell, be prepared to ask the locals some [[rape|probing]] questions like "Have you ever seen lights in the sky?" and "Do you know where [[Area 51]] is?" They'll often direct you towards the [[ghetto|worst parts of town]] where you can get the shit beaten out of you by [[Mexicans]] when asking about [[redundant|aliens]]. Of course, this was before becoming dirt poor with the air-base being closed down and turning into one giant [[conspiracy]]-generating tourist [[trap]]. Conversely, this was also the only place you could buy beer on a Sunday outside of a bar, as the city is under dry-county laws. This was almost 40 years ago, and not much has changed, except now there's a [[Superman|Super]]-[[Walmart]].

*<font size=4>[[Santa Claus|Santa Fe]]</font size>, state capital and heart of the [[art|artsy]] [[elitist]] universe. It consists of hippies, Bill Richardson, and a [[Led Zeppelin|mysterious stairway]]. New Mexico's answer to San Francisco, due to it's over saturation of flaming homosexuals polluting the city with their smug faggotry.

== Famous New Mexicans ==
[[Image:El_sismo.jpg|thumb|6 Million Pesos Man in action]]

*[[Whore|Demi Moore]]
*[[dead|John Denver]]
*Good old [[Rummy]] (famous among Injuns)
*The jiggaboo that hosts [[Pimp My Ride]] lived here before moving to [[California|the Fifth Circle of Hell]]
*[[Reverend Jacob K. Reist]], a [[pedo]] [[Scilon]]-supporting asshat who still writes [[shit|dead letters]] and fanfics about how Anti-Anon he is.
*Jew [[Mexican|Bill Richardson]], who tried/failed in the running for Democrats to some [[Barack Obama|spade]] and [[Hillary Clinton|skeezer]], even despite the fact he worked for Hillary's [[Bill Clinton|puppet with a penis]], and has literally done more for the country than either. [[Ruin|Not that it had any effect on his state's budget at all.]] Technically illegal, but because his mom was shipped over the border to have him by his [[pimp|rich, white father]], so it's a [[libel|toss-up]].
*Parts of [[oldfag]] bands like the broken-up [[Rape|At the Drive-In]] (mostly the [[gay]] parts that are in [[300|Sparta]] now) and [[Shit band|The Shins]].
*Conversely, shitty [[Crunkcore]] bands like [[BrokeNCYDE]] , named after the condoms their fuck-buddy parents bought being [[fail|a seriously bad batch]]. But thankfully, we only spawned them - it's fucking [[MySpace]] and [[Canada]] that made them popular. [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|Be sure to thank your local 16-year-old Canadian girl someday.]]
*[[Asian]] hackers constantly doing everything in their [[Over_9000|power]] to steal what few secrets American scientists have ever since they [[fail|dropped the ball]] at White Sands.
*[[Arnold Schwarzenegger|SkyNet, lulz]]; the semi-win series "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles" and the new "Terminator: Salvation" is/was filmed here. While on the subject, yes, the [[Bale Out|Christian Bale tape]] was made here. Also included in making this shitty state even moar poor - [[Anon|In Plain Sight]], the [[Michael Bay|Transformers movies]], parts of the original [[epic fail|Hulk]] movie, most desert scenes for [[video game|vidja gaems]] involving a desert use parts of the state for [[tracing|reference]]. And, of course, [[fanfiction|UFOs and robots]] are made here first. Again, [[poor|this has never once affected the state's economy, what, with all the tax-breaks]] and [[Mexican|hiring scale labor]] from the state's community colleges.
*Elizabeth Lambert, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEobeNfGcc "World's dirtiest soccer player."] Punched out [[over 9000]] [[Mormon|BYU]] soccer players and only received 1 yellow card.
*[[Dramasetter]], an [[EQ2]] player who robbed a Check N' Go
*[[Noone]] else matters
