E-Psychiatrist
[[Image:Random.jpg|thumb|It is my expert opinion that you are [[retard]]ed.]]

Are you [[problem]] free? Are you an enlightened, happy, content [[human being]] who merely uses the [[internet]] for a bit of light-hearted fun and relaxation after a productive day of [[college|study]] and/or [[Lollerskates|work]]? Do you have a wonderful life filled with good [[friend]]s, good [[food]] and good times?

Thousands of people think that you don't even though they have never met you.

These people are called '''e-Psychiatrists'''.

[[E (prefix)|e-]]Psychiatrists have absolutely no [[street cred|qualifications]], [[education]] or capability to assess your [[:Category:Abnormal Psych|psyche]], and yet they will diagnose you with all manner of [[crazy|crazies]]. 

For example, if you get into [[flame war|fun argument]] with somebody on the internet about something trivial, the e-Psychiatrist will instantly tell you that you have an [[antisocial personality disorder]] or a schizoid disorder.

The diagnosis of an E-Psychiatrist can be used as [[e-vidence]] against you in an [[internet trial]], and are therefore often employed as consultants by [[e-lawyers]]. Note that e-Psychiatry should never be used in concert with an [[e-meter]], as [[Scientologists]] are opposed to ''all'' forms of psychiatry.
