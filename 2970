First post
On certain [[forum]]s and at certain [[journal]]s, the "first post" is highly coveted by [[Attention Whore|attention-]][[Seaking|seeking]] [[comment whore]]s, who quickly declare their [[post]]'s status as such. This is a bannable offense at [[Something Awful]], while it is usually awarded a certain amount of [[epoints]] on [[Jameth]]'s [[LiveJournal]]. On [[Slashdot]] it is considered [[GNAA]] [[troll|trolling]] and blocked immediately. 

On [[Fark]] the words "first post" are changed to "[[Boobies]]" and the timestamp is [[bump]]ed up by 12 hours.  This is the only funny thing that happens on Fark.  

On http://www.thesuperficial.com every single blog post is full of [[Retards|people]] trying to get the first post with the [[Win|winners]], [[Fail|losers]], and those who think first posting is stupid all cussing each other out and e-fighting over first posting.

MaxofS2D shows us that even the french are annoyed by first comments.
