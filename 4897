Little Green Footballs

The place on the internet where the [[Head-Puncher|head-puncher]]s hang out, [[Little Green Footballs]] is a [[fascist|neo-nazi]] [[blog]] for [[Republican]]s who wear [[tinfoil hats]] and hate brown people. If you're European though, [[Little Green Footballs]] is a hedonistic group of tree-hugging nigger-loving marxists and are horrible bullies who attack European nazis just for being nazis - a hate crime.

Originally began as a biker blog for those who wanted to ride their Harley Davidsons without a helmet, but, after [[9/11]], felt they needed to do something more, like get addicted to sex-power fantasies involving swarthy foreigners. Unfortunately, the [[internets]] is suffering as a result. 

==History==

The site was created in [[2001]] by a [[basement dweller]] fed up with the [[old media|liberal media]] and people disagreeing with him.  The creator may in fact be a [[hobbit]], [[pedophile]], Elvis Presley, or even [[pirat_ponton]], as not much is known about him.  The only known photo is to the right, with the bald head.  It is uncertain as to whether [[cosplay]] is involved, or if there's some conservative Hell's Angels group ready to stir [[shit]] at a [[shit bands]]'s concert.

[[Last Thursday]], the owner of the site woke up and realised that all his friends were troglodytic Fascist assholes.  On [http://washingtonindependent.com/39629/civil-war-raging-in-right-wing-blogosphere some shitty blog], they b& him, he b& them, and everyone sane had a good laugh.
