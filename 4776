The cry of a new soul that has discovered that the internet is not all fun and games, '''leave me alone''' has existed throughout the ages as the death knell to any [[dignity]] the person had remaining.

==Usage==
:'''Prima:''' "You're a fucking fat ass douche. Get out of the basement, stop jacking off to [[hentai]], and give up on any hope of getting a girlfriend with that needle dick of yours."
:'''Secunda:''' "Why are you so mean ;___;. Just leave me alone." 

===Examples===
*[[Britney Spears]] via her out-of-drag persona [[Chris Crocker]]
*Any [[emo]] kid, even though they're clearly [[attention whore|asking]] [[asking for it|for it]].
*[[Maneaeve]]
*[[Tori Sue Heck]], another example of a whiny emo furry bitch who's just [[asking for it|ASKING FOR IT]]
