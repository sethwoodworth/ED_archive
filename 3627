'''Harlow Cuadra''' is a [[butthurt]] ([http://www.boybatterbucks.com/galleries/02/02/?id=1526648 literally] [[lol]]) [[gay]] ex-[[porn]] star and "escort" [http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=130720&ran=247053] who has starred in several [[popular]] films.  Also he's been charged with [[murder]].

== Murder Charges==

On January 25, 2007, it was reported that Cobra Video owner Bryan Kocis was found dead inside his fire-damaged home.  Four months later investigators were able to follow the trail of evidence to Cuadra and his accomplice, Joe [[kekeke|Kerekes]], after completing [[Computer Science III]] and reading their [[email]]s.

Cuadra and Kerekes have been charged with:
* murder
* burglary
* robbery
* arson 
* theft
* tampering with evidence, and
* '''abuse of a corpse'''
all in a conspiracy to [[final solution|eliminate the competition]] and lure underage [[twink]] porn star [[Dustin Michaels|Sean "Brent Corrigan" Lockheart]] away from Kocis' Cobra Video [http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=124727&ran=4499].

== Drama ==
Minutes after the story broke, web sites[http://www.freeharlowcuadra.com/] [http://www.myspace.com/2wronglyaccused] [http://myspace.com/harlowcuadra] were set up across the [[internets]] to help free the "wrongly accused."

About an hour after that the gay [[blog]]s were [[flaming|on fire]] with [[sick fuck]]s saying they would still [[anal sex|bend over]] for Harlow Cuadra.
