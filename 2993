Flea Market Montgomery is an [[old meme]] that features a [[Fat|fatass]] [[nigra]] [[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air|rapping]] about his shitty store, which is apparently just like a mini-mall. Many [[Lulz|lulz]] were had. The overly energetic [[nigra]], who almost certainly smokes ten grams of [[Drug|crack]] with his morning coffee, is actually named [[Powerword|Sammy Stephens]]. He enjoyed a nice ride in the limelight, but in the end, just like all old memes, the Flea Market Montgomery ad ran its course, experiencing the classic steps of old-memedom.

:1. Gain [[meme]] status.
:2. Go on ''[[Fag|The Ellen Show]]''.
:3. [[Hookers and blow|Hookers and blow.]]
:4. [[Tay Zonday|Fade into obscurity.]]
:5. [[????]]
:6. [[PROFIT!]]

However, one thing nobody expected was the epic revival...

==Revival==
At approximately 12:46 A.M. EST on May 8, 2008, an [[epic]] like [[B|/b/]] had never before witnessed occurred.  [[Mod|The full-length Flea Market Montgomery video was embedded on 4chan's /b/]], leading [[Newfag|Anonymous]] to scream cries of "WTFHAX!!11!," and [[Shit bricks|shit a great deal of bricks]].  This will certainly lead to many more [[Shoop|shoops]] and [[Fail|fail]], forcing Flea Market Montgomery into the realm of [[All Your Base|old-memedom]] once again.
