Alyssa

[[Image:Alyssa.jpg|thumb|Alyssa.]]

Alyssa is without a doubt the biggest [[ass]] [[whore]] ever shat into existence. Because she constantly fails at life and lives with her family in a FEMA trailer, but pays 10 bucks a month to wiz on avatar palace, she thinks she can take out her [[shit]] on other people. In particular the users of this [[Chat Palace|fine chat system]] mainly populated by [[13 year old boys]], [[16 year old girls]], [[juggalo]]s, [[emo]]s, [[goth]]s and [[fag]]gots. 

Even though Alyssa is well in her 30's, she still has an obsession with "blinkies" and little boys, who she often e-cheats with. So far she e-cheated on her assclown excuse for a husband Ronnie with Wes, Ethan, and Clintz (15 years old) which basically also makes her a [[pedophile]]. She used to be married with some guy named Joe, who went off to get a pack of cigarettes after one of her constant bitching sessions and never came back. Leaving her alone with his spawn Aaron. She later shit out another kid with this Ronnie Character whom she met on a [[furry]] fandom site and is also in to [[mudkip]] and [[Rangerphile]] [[scat]] [[porn]].

Needless to say a lot of centipedes went along with shitting each kid out of her chlamydia ridden vagina.

==The fucking god damn blinkies==

[[Image:Alyssaaidsblinkie1.gif|thumb|Alyssa shoves baseball bats up her old centipedes ridden vagina.]]

Even though Alyssa is in her 20's, as mentioned before, she is infantile, crazy, and full of [[AIDS]]. She likes to "make" blinkies and distribute them on to websites mostly occupied by [[13 year old boys]] and [[16 year old girls]]. That is, if making them means stealing them from those little kids and claiming them as your own. It got to such a point those goonies had enough of her stealing and made an online petition against her:

{{quote| To:  Anyone 

We believe that Alyssa of http://lalaalyssa.com has stolen blinkie templates, has harassed people, and has hacked someone's Photobucket account/email/LiveJournal. She has accused a PBF forum member of stealing graphics, when she was the one stealing herself. Plus, the forum member didn't steal a single thing. We believe its unfair that the victims get screwed, and the villian (Alyssa) gets away with it. We will not stop till something is done. May it be shutting down her site or possibly charging her with harassment or worse. Its time something is DONE! 

Sincerely,  | The undersigned (the children)}}

Why of course someone who steals shit and hacks in to children's photobuckets, emails and livejournals should wiz on avatar palace, another place kids love to hang out at. Spoil their fun there too! Good idea! Her reply to this was as always like a mean old troll bitch, fortunatly for the kids she doesn't moderate any blinkie site except for her own [[shit]] blinkie site, the reply:

{{quote| About the blinkies on my site...
There are MANY blinkies on my site. Some are made by me, these are ones that SAY they are made by me. There are MANY not made by me. These I DO NOT claim as my own, nor have I ever claimed them as my own. The blinkies on my site, that werent made by me, are FREEWARE blinkies. Freeware means whoever made them, then made them open for others to make and edit. There are also some that people have made and CLAIMED as "theirs" However, what they did was..take a pixell from another site, then stuck some boxes on it..and called it "theirs". I however, find that retarded and do not play that game. If they didnt make it pixel for pixel, then its free for others to use.PERIOD! You cant claim something that isnt yours to begin with as yours, just because you stuck some blinking boxes on it. So, there are some of those on my site too.

I completely agree with giving credit WHERE IT IS DUE.
However, i WILL NOT credit you for work that isnt yours. I dont care how much you
scream and bitch about it. People claiming stuff that isnt theirs is WRONG..so dont even 
bring your crap to me, cause i simply wont have it.
Now, if there is a pixel on my site, that has been altered or placed on a blinkie, that is YOUR pixel. Meaning you made it yourself and can show me proof of this, like by your site, etc..and you want it removed. I am COMPLETELY ok with that. All ya gotta do is email me at LaLaAlyssa@aol.com and tell/show me which one and I will remove it. If you TOOK someone elses pixels and made a blinkie and want to claim it, dont bother. You cant claim what isnt yours | Alyssa the cuntwhore}}

==Manual to stalk Alyssa==

Alyssa had made her own stalking manual before, although true: Who in the name of [[shit]] would stalk an uberbitch that looks like a heroine hooker? Your guess is as good as any. The "facts" below where taken of her own website, because the voices in her mind starting stalking her about them. Have many [[moar]] [[lulz]] using them wherever you like:
