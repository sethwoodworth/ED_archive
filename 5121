Effete spelling of [[magic]], now with a "k" for extra phear!  Used to demonstrate that the user is really [[stupid|cool]], [[1337]] and clued in to a centuries-old tradition of real, authentic, honest-to-goodness magic, and not merely a [[Wicca|deluded poseur]].  

Supporters of this aberrant spelling will be all "blah blah Jew blah blah [[Shit nobody cares about|Crowley]] blah blah blah", but I'm all like "[[STFU|talk to the hand]]". 

Some [[1337]] magickians noted on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] include [[Son of Art]], [[Usva]] and [[Nathan Satan]].
