'''IMVU''' is a  [[shitty]] automated [[chat]] program that allows many [[pedos]] to virtually have [[rape|sex]] with [[12 year old girls|13 year old girls]]. Like [[Second Life]] this site has a huge [[furry]] infestation. The site consists primarily of [[furries]], [[goths]], [[wiggers]], [[emos]], [[fags]], [[dykes]], etc. Trolling is a lost art form in IMVU.

Besides having multiple labeled communities, the people who seem to inhabit the site have a sort of "''hate''" for the [[the man|management]]. Being the failed attempt at being [[Second Life]], IMVU has been on [[beta]] mode for like 3 years and continue to produce mass [[fail]] with every little update.  [[Butthurt]], IMVU decided to create fun little [[tool]]s for the community to distract them from the shit.

Some time [[last Thursday]], IMVU decided to toss up some bonus features and content to its users.  At least to the users who want to pay out the [[ass]] for them.  Such features include new dances, new moves, new clothing you can't normally get (which is basically ''every'' article of clothing), new ways to assrape teens, animations, music, disco lights, plush toys (for raping), sex toys, electric chairs, and a partridge in a pear tree. Even the [[Pope]] himself has played this game along with [[Jesus]], the real guy.  Oh, and you can also pay to register your name permanently (which means you're no longer a "Guest_" on IMVU) if you really feel like stealing mommy's credit card to do so.

==The Forum==
Possibly the main and only area for [[lulz]], the forums on IMVU consist of [[butthurt]] [[faggots]] and [[12 year old girls]] who spend hours [[trolling]] others while getting a huge hard on for anyone else who adds to the trolling. For some reason a great number of the people in the "[[Forum|off-topic]]" section (O-T for short) are particularly [[retarded]]. Especially the losers who has been there for many years and think they are the shit. Many have the need to write [[random]] topics about [[shit nobody cares about|their lives and how they are doing]]. The Off-Topic forum has three topics: 
* [[Stalking|Crushes]]
* [[WTF|Family Groups]]
* [[fail|Begging]]

===Crushes===
Crushes on Imvu are about as normal as [[Bush]] not pulling out of [[Iraq]]. When in doubt, get a fellow internet [[fuck]] buddy. The main reason people on IMVU date is not to date, but to get rid of a huge boner that has been erect for over a hour. When on the forum its constant '''"<3"''' '''"lets fuck"''' 

===Family Groups===
This has to be the biggest pile of [[lulz]] on the whole [[fucking|damn]] site. People on the OT [[Gay|love each other very much]] and like to make [[Fandom|Packs]] in each of these [[gangbang|Packs]] theres a leader, a real [[lolcow]] who is a overly happy [[aspie]] who spends about 6 or 7 hours on IMVU forums posting shit with the supposed "'''^_^'''" 

===Begging===
Begging on IMVU is apparently the [[Anti-lulz]] and is considered lower than worshiping [[Satan]] or killing innocent [[Bitches|babies]] with a kitchen knife. Rather than ignore the begging, they make stickers to avoid the [[Rape|butthurt]] of beggars.

===Off Topic===
It's heavily-trolled.

===Trolling opportunities===
several things make this website easy to troll

1) there are no filters on names which makes trolling almost too easy

2) there are no filters on chat you say in a room. so threatening to kill people, [[rape]] them, and eat their corpse are awwwwww right!!!!

3) certain words when typed in chat cause all people in the chat to hear a [[ear rape|scripted sound]]. these sounds are all ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  this should be your bread and butter; if you aren't typing threats, eating food, or taking a shit you should be [[spam|spamming]] this furiously for maximum [[win]] (and [[ear rape]]).

best found so far: scream, makes a high pitched wail that can blow out eardrums if your headphones are on.
