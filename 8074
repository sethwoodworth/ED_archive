Tegaki E is a mostly [[shit]] website for ex-[[/b/]] [[newfags]] and [[weeaboos]]. It's the bastard lovechild of [[DeviantArt]] and [http://opencanvas.en.softonic.com OpenCanvas], and [[stupid|Down's Syndrome]] brother of [http://www.art.com/ Art.com]. Tegaki E gives users the [[shit nobody cares about|awesome power of Flash]] to create pieces of [[shit|art]] and whine about not having a tablet. A glance at the front page will reveal nothing but shitty [[fanart]], [[furry]] [[bullshit]], and [[yaoi]]. Occasionally, something good might come up, but the [[Dumbass|members]] will often ignore it so they can comment on [[shit|shitty]] [[anime]] drawings instead.

== History ==
Tegaki E started out as a [[weeaboo|Japanese]] website, known as just Tegaki [[stupid|(the E signifies "English")]]. The original Tegaki features nothing but anime, and the color pallet contains literally two colors. It has a "TegaKING" system in which the most favorited members are featured on the front page. Tegaki also provides the option to change one's profile color, which makes using the Japanese version instead of the English [[lie|totally worth it]].

== The Site ==
Tegaki E's front page features both a Recent Entries section and a Random Entries section, both of which are a perfect way to see accidental [[yaoi]] [[porn|pronz]]. It also has an Active Blogs section. When this section was introduced, the [[internet tough guy|site admin]] didn't actually reveal what it did, only calling it [[lol wut|"some sort of list"]]. This singlehandedly proves that [[bullshit|the admins truly know exactly what they're doing.]]

== LCC ==
LCC stands for [[Longcat]] Central. This section of the site is where [[retard|users]] post bullshit combos and pretend they know what "[[epic win]]" even means. Posts in LCC are generally retarded scribbles, shitty longcats, and violations of [[rules 1 & 2]].

== Active Blogs ==
<s>The Active Blogs list features 80% [[anime]], 20% [[shit]] that isn't [[anime]], meaning that around 100%  is completely retarded. The most active blogs are perpetually the same people, all taking about two seconds out of each day to draw [[shitty]] anime, proving that none of them have any talent. The truth is, [[nobody gives a shit]] about the active blogs. Not even the site admins, who keep [[pwn]]ing random aspects of the website and fucking everything up.</s> Active Blogs has been [[pwn|pwned]] by [[dumbass|tewi]].

== [[Idiot|Users]] ==

Users are generally batshit [[13-year-old boy|13-year-olds]] who spread the doctrine of [[kawaii]] by means of shitty animu drawings. There was a time when shitty art was difficult to find (i.e. the scribblings of a three-year-old), but now the front page is plastered with it, constantly. Many faggots like [http://www.unowen.net/tegaki/uentries.php?u=7751 Mousekatchan] and lulzchan (srsly) try to exploit memes for their own [[sick fuck|sadistic]] [[wapanese]] agenda.

Tegaki E is also a haven for furries and retards alike. Most notably, [http://www.unowen.net/tegaki/uentries.php?u=6691 Oxnard], who whores its (referred to as "it" because it is obviously [[furry|inferior]]) [[Hamtaro|sick fetish]] to gain comments and attention. Oxnard runs a fascist agenda attempting to convert other unsuspecting straight guys into [[fags]], mainly for its own personal satisfaction. Oxnard is also a [[partyvan|pedophile]], an admitted [[fag]], and a Jew black person.

== Commenting ==
[[Image:Oldmakescombohurr.jpg|thumb|Old Proud. Old feel fuzzy wet penis now.]]

The comment system is now confirmed by the [[FCTC]] as a quite lulzy and simple way to troll. The long time between bans, simple input system, and innefectual ban system can be easily exploited for lulz. Mild skill and imagination is required as simply spamming the comments of certain pieces of 'art' is not possible. Spamming the frontpage with similarly themed masterpieces is, however, quite possible with even a small band of trolls, due to the small user base in comparison to, say, deviantart. The frontpage could quite easily be flooded by a half dozen trolls given half an hour or so, and a sprinkling of inspiration.

Combos can be made in the comments section, and extensions to art made.

For example, if a piece truncates a character at his waist, you may extend beyond the legs, drawing penises or saggy flaps. Follow your volition, it's really quite simple.
