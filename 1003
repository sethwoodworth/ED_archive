Bitzi
'''Bitzi''' is a [[Wikipedia]]-like site, only it gathers [[shit nobody cares about|files information]] found on [[P2P]] networks. Well, that's the official line. Practicly, they give you softwares to report [[shit|everything]] you have on your computer. It has [[over 9000]] [[faggot|bitizens]] and reported files (actually it's over 10 mil), and is [[hard|growing]] by the day. It's run by a [[gay|guy]] named Gordon (with the nick [[fag|gojomo]]), who has no idea what trolls are and why he shouldn't have them on his site. In fact, he's actually been known to try to reason with them/learn what the "community" they say they represent want. All in all, a [[rape|fun]] place and a home for [[pedophiles]]. Like [[Agentmike]].

==  Notable [[faggot|bitizens]] ==
* Currently known as [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/the_keymaster keysheister], this troll is a no-life [[basement dweller]] which after his own admitance, had [[over 9000]] sockpuppets. He gets his kicks in trying (with great efforts) to rape [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/erakun another member], having little succes. He's accompanied by his whore, [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/hawley hawley], suspected to be just another sock-puppet. The latter does however seem to have a more open attitude to the talks, but their both arrival in talks at almost the same time seems to suggest the sock-puppet faggotry.  And then she got [[ban|permab&]], [[LULZ]]!
* ''Erakun'', your basic [[internets]] [http://redwing.hutman.net/~mreed/warriorshtm/eaglescout.htm eagle scout], has eyes for trolls and has their eyes in return. On the past year, he has reported [[over 9000]] shitprints, catching the [[drama|envy]] of the troll, unhappy that are people that [[fap|can]] more then him.
* [[Agentmike]] was there!!!11oneone
* [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/trollster trollster] - well the name says much, fan of AgentMike's and seemingly a normal guy long on that site... but srsly, who believes that?
* [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/axxo axxo] (wait, what?) reason of much amuzing [http://i31.tinypic.com/9hl5pc.jpg drama].

== Recent developments ==
The [[admin]] finally wized up to the troll and now has him on a straight leash. Unfortunately, this seems to have opened the way for a [[lulz]] killer to get his lamebrain ideas across and stop people getting most of the delicious viruses from online programs. On the bright side, this [http://bitzi.com/bitizen/espada animu shithead] approves of anonymity.

== Defence ==

Some key player in Bitzi got offended by this [[shit]] article and decided to go on the rampage on ED. This culminated in their making of [[Bitzi2|a shitty page]] containing the following hilarity.
