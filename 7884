Subtext
[[image:subtext ftw.jpg|thumb|right|In this [[gay|touching]] scene, Kairi misinterprets the innocent actions of her friends.]] 
'''Subtext''' is all the hidden meanings behind the text or dialog or actions of your favorite [[fandom]]'s characters.  It's the stuff that makes it [[fact|SO OBVIOUS]] to you why [[Sephiroth]] and [[furry|Red XIII]] are totally having makeout sessions in the hangar bay of the Airship.  It is the thing that [[OTP]]s spring from.

It also, for the most part, doesn't exist.  But don't tell that to the fangirls.  Even if their favorite [[male]] character is constantly [[fuck|hitting]] on [[girl]]s, that sly glance he gave his male friend in 2 seconds of one episode three years ago means they're having ravenous [[anal]] [[List of sex moves|gangbang]]s within the rest of the male cast.

Just remember, you can't spell subtext without [[buttsex]](Mind=blown).
