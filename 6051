<s>'''Operation Oh Captain, My Captain''' is a /[[b]]/ [[operation]] with origins in /[[tv]]/ aimed to make a stand against [[ginger|Conan O'Brien]] being essentially fired from ''[[unfunny|The Tonight Show]]'' [[at least 100]] days ago. The goal is to get the entire audience of ''The Tonight Show'' to stand on their seats at the end of the show and yell "[[I'm gay|O Captain My Captain]]" in a show of support for Conan.

This comes in the wake of [[over 9000]] threads /b/ made supporting Conan when the news came down On January 12.

The primary means of achieving this is through [[fail|twitter]]. While twitter is generally seen as [[fucking stupid]] by the denizens of 4chan, it can be a powerful tool to get the word out.

Use the tag #ohcaptainmycaptain in conjunction with #teamconan and #keepconan to make the first tag start trending.

Message #teamconan celebrities and try to get them to RT (re-tweet) the message. Once they use the tag, everyone following them will, too, and it'll explode.

The basic goal is to get someone from the LA area to get in contact with someone who is going to be in the Tonight Show audience and relay them the instructions.

==Contacting The Audience==

[[Image:Ohcaptainmycaptainflyer.png|thumb|right|The Flyer you should hand copies of out to the audience line.]]

If you want this to work, you need someone in LA to get to the audience. Use facebook, twitter, etc... Make and bring signs, flyers, docs, etc with all the instructions! Print out a few copies of every the flyer to the right and pass it out to audience members. The goal of twitter is to reach SOMEONE in LA who can do the following:

The Conan audience holding area is on Lankershim Blvd in Universal City, just outside of Gate 3 into Universal.
The audience gathers around 2-3pm. If someone could get there with a sign or something you might have a chance of this happening. Tell them about Operation Oh Captain My Captain. Relay how many people on twitter and the internet are counting on them.

Better yet, print out copies of the instructions, get to the line, assign a leader to pass long the info.

Tell them to make sure the entire audience knows what to do BEFORE it happens. Go over the plan during commercials breaks. Make sure it's organized.

The last segment on Conan is the musical guest. As soon as the song ends Conan goes over and says Goodbye and the music plays. 

GET THE AUDIENCE TO DO IT AS SOON AS THE MUSICAL ACT ENDS, BEFORE CONAN SAYS SOMETHING, AND BEFORE THE BAND STARTS PLAYING AND DROWNS OUT THE CROWD'S CHANTING.
