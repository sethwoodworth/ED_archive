Godly Luck
'''Godly Luck''' was a minor, shitty [[forced meme]] on [[b|/b/]] killed by the removal of #fortune. But, as we all know, [[b|/b/]] will never die, as long as there is a [[Narutard|Narutard]] that exists on the fucking board, faggotry will never cease to function.

== What the #fuck? ==

It all began on October 3rd, 2007, which started out much like any other day at /b/, replete with the usual [[faggotry|shenanigans]] and [[lulz|hijinx]]. However, as the day wore on it became quite clear to the /b/tards that something [[gay|hinky]] was afoot with the ritual [[gay|guessing of the #fortune game]].

On a 'normal' day, everyone knows that [[fortune|#fortune]] goes in all fields and that you will then randomly receive one of a handful of fortunes -one of which is '''"Godly Luck"'''- when you submit your [[post]]. Ergo, there's about a 1-in-5 chance that your fortune will be '''"Godly Luck"'''.

[[Newfag]]s, who are easily entertained, will spend hours trying to guess their #fortune but when there was a sudden surge of #fortunefags repeatedly  correctly guessing that their #fortune was '''"Godly Luck"''' [[Anonymous]] began to [[shit bricks]]; something was rotten in the state of [[4chan|Denmark]]. 

From an initial post where someone correctly guessed their luck, a [[screencap]] was made and again anon posted the [[screenshot]] and guessed "Godly Luck" with the fortune "Godly Luck". More and more were posted and [[demotivators| d-mo's]] were made and used. Nothing could stop this powerful force. <br><br> There can only be one explanation:

== LOL MODS ==

It is believed that mods in fact started doing this to create a [[forced meme]]. Of course, only complete [[retard]]s who don't know that people can delete their own threads right after they make one and try again believe this stupidity. Thanks to fast "Delete post" button clicking skills, Godly Luck was everywhere, and no one could stop it.
