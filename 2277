== Name and history ==
Diochan is a less than cunning wordplay used to resemble swearing common in Italian as "''dio''" = god and "cane" = dog. Founded in [[2007]] by an [[underage]] [[Pok√©mon]] fanboy known as MarcoZ, it was originally devised to lure little children into his hands. Being the astounding [[newfag]] he is, he didn't want (and couldn't) manage the site if his own life depended on it, and the boards were plagued with all fashions of bugs and assorted shit. A little short later, after getting barely to 5000GET, he decided to put the administration in someone else's hands, and it seemed a choice for the good. The following day, the site was wiped clean from the old database and he wasn't the King of the ball anymore :(

After that, Diochan changed [[OVER 9000]] hosts in search for someone that didn't crash the site every odd day of the month, even having a mirror in [[Africa|Uganda]]. Then MarcoZ came back with a vengeance and bought a dedicated hosting for his beloved creature, in a gesture that met the [[Who cares|complete indifference]] of the userbase. [[Jews|Another rich user]] bought diochan.com and then everyone rejoiced.

Diochan's longevity has more to do with their constant raiding of high-impact forums such as [http://www.tradizione.biz/forum/index.php Tradizione] than any real sense of community. Users are still arguing after years about which meme was forced and if that particular camwhore is to be praised or insulted, [[Shit_nobody_cares_about|and other very important issues]].

According to [[User:Tom Metzger|Tom Metzger]] (aka [[Some Guy]]) recently a rival Italian chan (amazingly, there is more than one) called [http://www.pastachan.com/ Pastachan] joined [[Anontalk]] in fucking [[4chan]] up, pretending to be Diochan users to pass the blame on Diochan (established *chan tradition). Successfully spamming the smaller boards, taunting about how they can't be spammed back due to foreign IP banning preventing potential raids against them. They apparently spammed 4chan using [[4chan.js]] style macros to [[rape]] the shit out of the boards. After [http://www.pastachan.com/ Pastachan] was linked on ED and [http://www.pastachan.com/ Pastachan]'s admin repeatedly and unsuccesfully tried to remove the links, he [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|DELETED FUCKING EVERYTHING]] and redirected [http://www.pastachan.com/ Pastachan] to Diochan.

[[And nothing of value was lost]].

According to [[User:Welling|Welling]] (aka [[butthurt]]) he is NOT [http://www.pastachan.com/ Pastachan]'s admin and [[noone]] was trying to censor this article during the previous month.

Diochan was apparently responsible for starting the [[Cornelia]] spam on 4chan when it was spamming the boards of 4chan.

== Boards ==
[[Image:DioChanBan.png|thumb|"You have been banned from all boards"]]
Diochan has:
* /b/, that was even originally called /rd/, hosts horrible, mangled and unfunny copypasta translated into their moonspeak. Also, it hosts some original content and some degree of [[trolling]], along with political discussion of any sort and was invaded by [[France|Frenchfags]], [[Nazi|Germanfags]] and [[unfunny|random faggots from]] [[4chan]] and in several occasions (special mention to the [[basement dweller|cool guize]] of [[not420chan]] that made the most [[epic fail|fail raid that ever failed]]);
* /s/, where suicide girls and fetish photos of obese women abound, with the occasional sprinkle of [[CP]] courtesy of our beloved [[Russian]] friends;
* /h/, where the most prominent content is scat or guro with little to no posts;
* /a/, and all the [[weeaboo|weeabooness]] that comes from it along with some [[JewTube]] anime dubbed in mumbo-jumbo;
* /v/, where the most recent game discussed is straight from the [[At least 100 years ago|20th century]];
* /o/, [[oekaki]] that has quality so low [[deviantART]] pales in shame. Unlike deviantART, there's less inflation fetish and more [[penis]]es;
* /ck/, that answers to the long-felt need to have MOAR PASTA.

There have even been a bunch of secret boards but they were mostly hidden and not disclosed since the admins fear that, if they were released, this would mean the death of /b/ for lack of posts. <s>Every one in a while some [[fag|spider expert]] suggests getting [[/y/]] or [[/fur/]], but everyone flames him immediately to oblivion. Apparently, Diochan are [[Catholics]] and they don't want to [[yiff in hell|rot in hell]].</s> <s>[[Shit_nobody_cares_about|Now Diochan has /y/, /co/, /k/ and /gif/.]]</s> NOT ANYMORE, /co/ excluded.

The current trend in board requests spans from /helpdesk/ to /hr/. Admins exploited this trend by asking money in exchange for temporary custom boards. The [[Mussolini|DVCE]] wasn't pleased by this display of jewry.

== Memes ==
* Spitty Cash, a Romanian rapper
* [[Italy|Berlusconi]], who is a walking meme factory
* Abufinzio, a horrible guy venerated as a deity for no reason at all
* [[Bullshit|Hayden Panettiere]] and her passion to suck [[bestiality|dogs' cocks]];
* The mighty [[Mussolini|DVCE]]
* [[Batman|The goddamn Batman]] who covers the role of [[Captain Obvious]].

== Trivia ==
Anonymous in Diochan becomes Anonimo.

Diochan is currently owned by [[who cares|who knows]]? Probably it's the same people that create all those Italian threads on 4chan to get [[newfag|new users]] and the subsequent [[fail]]. In this regard, they contribute in purging the already cancerous [[/b/]] from all those illiterate fucks. Though so, when people go to post in [[Engrish]] in Diochan, its users politely reply back in [[English]].

It is a widely shared opinion on Diochan that "it needs [[moar]] pasta".

Diochan users constantly fear that someday the [[Mussolini|government]] or the media or [[Concerned_mother|someone else]] will find out about their [[Shitty|awesome and edgy]] website and [[Party van|shut it down]], because Italy has not yet imported [[free speech]] from the great country that is the U.S. of A.
