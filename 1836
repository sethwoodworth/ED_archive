 '''Creative Commons''' is [[teh futar]].

'''Creative Commons''' is a system of licenses (confusing jargon) that permits individuals ([[hippies]], [[liberals]], [[fags]], [[etc]].) to use or appropriate (steal, manipulate, fuck with) your work (stupid [[meme]]s, animutations, shitty demo tapes, [[Wikipedia]] articles) without obtaining your expressed written permission.
Lawrence Lessig ([[communism|commie bastard]]) developed this system as an alternative to restrictive [[copyright]] laws. Lessig also believes in P2P servers and free exchange of information. He was assassinated in 2006 by the [[MPAA]].

If you label something as Creative Commons, you cannot sue someone for [[copyright infringement]] later.

== So where's the drama? ==

{{warning|Nobody understands the copyright laws. Nobody.}}

Just like all other fine, great, amazing, rose-tinted, sky-blue, green-grassed, happy-fluffy thingies of all happy future utopias, Creative Commons is a constant source of drama because no one understands what the hell they are using the licenses for, and what the hell other people are using the licenses for.

=== Don't copy this shit...oh, wait-- ===

Creative Commons is intended for works that are to be freely distributed and dis[[fuck|seminated]]. If that doesn't sound good to you, ''why the hell are you using a Creative Commons license?''

Artists are often confused to hell and back by all this license weirdness. Sites like [[Flickr]] and [[deviantART]] make it dead simple to add a CC license to your artwork, which can lead to a funny situation when said artwork is proudly displayed as having a CC license, yet the artist-scribed image description reads, "don't copy this picture or I'll crush your ballz". And gadzooks, if some people actually use the picture in a way that the CC license permits, massive [[butthurt]] ensues.

If [[you]] don't know what the hell you're doing, ''don't use a CC license''. Click on the bloody license link and read the Creative Commons Deed (the deed text is as short as possible to enable every idiot to understand it, unlike the [[GNU]] [[GPL]], which presents the reader with a [[tl;dr|text wall]]); if those terms don't look good to you, you can choose another CC license or don't license the work under CC license.

=== Just slap a CC license on the side, it fixes everything ===

As stated above, it's too damn easy to slap a Creative Commons license on a piece of artwork, usually comprised of images stolen from some random source or other. Of course, this is nothing new: people have been wrongly claiming copyright on other people's works since the dawn of time. The only difference here is that people who abuse CC licenses spread the license notices everywhere like candy. This is especially [[ironic]] because CC licenses are intended for proper attribution and honest use of copyright for a better tomorrow [[Shit nobody cares about|and all that shit]]. In short, people who don't know shit about copyright law shouldn't be granted the opportunity to use a nice, easy, simple copyright chooser widget thingy.

Creative Commons solves the big license problem for original content, but it sure as hell doesn't provide any additional security to people who want to reuse the content. You still have to be skeptical about the copyright status of some works, especially since so many people don't know anything about how the licenses they chose are supposed to function.

Triple irony points if you find someone crying about someone redistributing a CC-licensed image that they originally copied from somewhere...

=== It's teh communism! ===

CC is extremely confusing to those who distribute images, or would like to rip off pictures. You see, using a Creative Commons license is [[Communism|COMMUNISM]]. It doesn't allow the picture to be [[art theft|ripped off]], as is done in the Proper [[Capitalism|Capitalist]] System where everyone is allowed to steal everyone else's work. No, Creative Commons licenses ''allow'' people to steal the work, thus causing massive unemployment for image thieves! What's the point of stealing stuff if you are allowed to do that in the first place?

== Examples ==

* Playwright Max Sparber has distributed plays under a Creative Commons license that allows people to duplicate them. He released ''boyELROY'' into the public domain. Of course, nobody in the entire world is interested in duplicating the play, nor does anybody know who Max Sparber is.
* [[LittleCloud]] [[fail]]s to understand the slight contradiction in the following statements:
{{quote|Some rights reserved. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 License.}}
{{quote|You may <u>not</u> use my artwork anywhere, for any reason, without first being given my expressed permission.
