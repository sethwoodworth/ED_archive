'''Carl [[wop|Paladino]]''' was the [[Republican]] nominee for Governor in [[New York]]. His platform includes all the [[batshit insane]] homophobic positions of the [[teabaggers|Tea-party GOP]], but what sets him apart from the rest is [[troll|how he has conducted his campaign]], which has included [[what|sending garbage-scented flyers to potential voters]]. He is also a known aficionado of [[Mr. Hands|horse porn]], as seen [http://wnymedia.net/paladino/ here]. 

The [[Internets]] at large first heard about Carl back when he was the Teabagger darling underdog and not the Republican nominee for governor of a major state. Like every other dipshit [[redneck]] and [[racist]] in the country, Carl was forwarding around [[hilarious]] racist e-mails about [[Obama]] from his [[AOL]] e-mail account. He figured it'd just be some good old-fashioned racism mixed with [[bestiality]] [[porn]] among friends, right? Of course, some [[troll]] had to forward the e-mails to the [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/nyregion/13paladino.html media], ruining innocent fun among friends.

He's basically the [[4chan]] of American politics.

== Greatest Hits ==

* [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/nyregion/11paladino.html Telling] a bunch of [[Jews]] in [[hipsters|Williamsburg]] how he has nothing against [[gays]] he just thinks they're disgusting and less than human(though he's [[fapping|totally cool with]] [[bestiality]]). This, coming from being [[offended]] by a gay pride parade, oblivious to the fact the whole point of them is to [[Trolling IRL|troll people like him IRL.]]
* Almost [http://capitaltonight.com/2010/09/fight/ punching] a reporter from [[Fox News|The New York Post]] in the face. But then again, everyone has wanted to do this at one time or another.
* Losing the election before a single vote is even cast, because this is New York and he's a Republican.
* Being [[guido|Italian]]. Wait...isn't the other guy...?
* Having a bad temper. But then again, the other guy has that too. Ain't New York politics grand?

Carl is against [[taxes]], a favorite pastime of [[white people]] in upstate New York, but only as long as those taxes are paying for poor people to get health insurance or food. If the government money is benefiting real-estate scumbags like himself, he is quite alright with taxes and spending.

==Sexuality==

[[Image:Eric-holder-picture.jpg|right|thumb|Sexy bitch.]]
Carl recently [http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2010/10/paladino_curses.php informed] the world that he wants some of that hott federal prosecutor ass:

{{quote|Questioner: "If you were the chief executive of New York, what would your response be to the attorney general of the United States deciding to hold terrorist trials in Manhattan?"
Paladino: "F*** him. F*** him."}}

So his response to federal terrorist trials in Manhattan is to have [[buttsex]] with the prosecutor. This has not stopped all of the Upstate hicks from putting his signs all over their asbestos-infested double-wides, however.

==Irony==

He's also famous for using the "Mad as hell" line from ''Network'', in an un-ironic way (since that movie is basically making fun of people like him before it was cool), as only teabaggers can. When he actually won the Republican nomination to [[noone|everyone]]'s surprise, his campaign signs [[it is a mystery|mysteriously]] dropped that line. Oh, and he's also a [http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/04/06/2010-04-06_buffalo_blowhard_wants_your_vote_mad_as_hell_carl_paladino_comes_off_as_a_shallo.html ladies' man], something like our current governor.

==Uncle Carl's Log Cabin==

Similar to the way [[Hitler]] himself said, "But my best friend is Jewish!" when the Allies came to Berlin to ask him [[wtf]] he was doing with all those ovens, Carl often points to the fact that his nephew (by marriage) is openly gay and [[prove me wrong|therefore]] how could he possibly be a homophobe? Aside from the fact that his nephew pretty much hates his guts, it turns out that his campaign manager doesn't mind [http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paladino_aide_had_gay_old_time_jjmInDE1Q8as4YTmLZARWO being licked] at a gay pride parade, either.

[[File:PaladinoFurry.jpg|right|thumb|Ducks this large usually get shot in Upstate New York.]]
Recent photographic evidence has surfaced that Carl might be a [[furry]], too, leading to the possibility of the first furry governor.

==Insanity==

As [[erection|election]] day approaches, math dork [[Michael Moore|Nate Silver]] has basically told Carl, "fuck it, you have no chance. Just go home and get drunk, you'll feel better in the morning." Carl decided to [http://wnymedia.net/smith/2010/10/carl-paladinos-halloween-drunktacular/ take him up] on his advice.

==Summary==

Tomorrow, Andrew Cuomo will be crowned King of New York as his hereditary rights demand, and Carl Paladino will go back to being a racist, homophobic, horse-fucking, scumbag real estate developer from the city on the infected anus of Lake Erie, [[Oniontown|Buffalo]].
