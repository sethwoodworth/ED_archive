Cpedia
__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__ [[File:Cpedia.png|frame]]What is '''Cpedia'''? No, it is not an encyclopedic repository of [[CP]]. It's not shorthand for [[Conservapedia]], it's not even a [[Wikipedia]] project devoted to the letter C. Cpedia is how [[Skynet]] will actually turn out, a gibbering idiot machine spewing rehashed nonsense rather than enslaving and exterminating humanity. Come, dear friends, and explore the confusing wonder that is Cpedia.

=Where the fuck did this come from?=
According to [[TOW|sources]], Cpedia is the dunderheaded brainchild of two no-longer-employees of [[Google]], Anna Patterson and Russell Power. It appears to be the retarded little brother of their unheard-of search engine, ''Cuil'' (pronounced [[wtf]],) which [[nobody]] uses because Google is approximately ten thousand times better. There is also a lot of boring garbage about the name ''Cuil'' and something about [[Ireland]], all indicating that the developers spent more time concocting the site's name than they did actually designing and programming things to work the right way.

=Delete 0231, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC) Speed deleted as patent nonsense.=
Cpedia gives us unique insight regarding the inner workings of the minds of schizophrenics who would edit [[TOW]] vehemently but were [[permabanned]] from the wiki. It does this all without needing any crazy conspiracy theorist or cat-ladies thanks to the incredible programming breakthrough of '''randomly combining every article for a keyword.''' Yes, that is in fact what Cpedia does. The results are, as can be expected, absolutely incomprehensible and utterly hilarious.

=Through the warped lens of Cpedia=
Let us take a moment to read some excerpts from Cpedia regarding popular subjects here on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] as well as some from the venerable [[Wikipedia]]:
==[[Yiff]]==
''In India, unlike other countries worldwide! I was broadcasted live video game! Only at Starpulse yiff furries bikini Contact yiff furries bikini moviemistakes.

''Yiff was originally invented by LittleFox as part of a range of onomatopoetic words that form the fox-ese language of the Furry role-playing community: yiff, yip, yerf, yaff, yarf, growf, and growlf (in order from most positive connotations to most negative connotations). [1.4] Yiff meant "yes" or an exuberant "hello!".

''This is the hidden leaf village.After naruto rein as hokage the villages was wipe out ad rebuilt it is now only half twice the size but it also takes up half of fire country.''

=Conclusions we had a machine draw for us=
Clearly this is the wave of the future and we may as well delete this and all other wikis, blogs, and everything else once Cpedia has gobbled up all our data and spit it back out at us in a confusing technicolor blur that our fragile and fleshy human minds cannot understand. In the future the internet will talk to itself. This is that future.
