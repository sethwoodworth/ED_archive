'''MyChurch''' [http://www.mychurch.org/] is a Christian social network which many argue . MyChurch offers a social network service for Christian churches with features modeled after those found in [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]]. In addition to standard services offered by social networking websites, MyChurch allows churches to post sermon podcasts, have event calendars, and '''collect tithes(taxes)''' (LOL) from members (for a service fee of $12 per month).

MyChurch's revenue comes from advertising and a premium subscription business model and has a presence of over 6900 churches. MyChurch has been compared to other Christian websites such as [[GodTube]] and [[Conservapedia]]. Although it is a Christian website, MyChurch encourages non-Christians to join for the [[lulz]].
