'''Gay God''' is a pompous, self-absorbed, [[gay|"homosexual"]], [[emo]] [[Jeffree Star|vegetarian]] (even though we all know he [[fellatio|eats meat]] amirite?). Ironically, he was apparently seen dating a girl in early 2008, but a 'pics or it didn't happen' policy has been applied.

He has a man-filled fanclub and sells overpriced gay T-shirts on his [[fucktard|amazing]] website. He was also voted 'cutest [[vegetarian]]' on [[PETA]] a while back. This proves that PETA is made up entirely of vegetarians. One of his groups is based around using smilies that he has taken from a website that advertises on MySpace. This probably means that he's giving out [[gay]] [[pr0n]] of himself to the members, because seriously, why else would one join?

Gay God's number one enemy, besides [[Anonymous|haters]] and meat, is fat. Every insult he throws at you is laced with 'omg well you're just a fatty with no life, go eat somemore Krispy Kremes you lard!' Too bad most of his fangirls are all [[fat|fat ass]] [[loli|13-year olds]] trying to look pretty in the $30.00 dollar Smashbox coverup mommy bought them (but omg, Smashbox doesn't test on animals guyz!). Even with their [[internet disease]]-ridden [[Fat girl angle shot|fat girl angle shots]] they cannot hide their [[OM NOM NOM NOM|greasy rolls]] of blubber that they [[fail|attempt]] to hide from the [[holocaust|Auschwitz]]-skinny Gay God.

Gay God is remarkably shallow, even by faggot standards.  Seriously, even most faggots hate him.  Case in point: On his "how to come out" video he revealed the horrible secret that when he first came out to his mom, SHE TOOK AWAY HIS [[goatse|INTERWEBZ]] FOR A WEEK OMG THAT INHUMAN BITCH!!!!, ignoring the fact that a lot of gay people suffer from a lot worse when they come out.  Truth be told, internet banning seems to be the worst problem Gay God has ever dealt with, which is probably what led to his remarkable ability to be a perfect little shit.

Gay God is quite fond of eBaying off his PETA sweaters and underwearz; his auctions always end with bids of [[over 9000]] dollars due to the masses of horny fantards who would sell their souls to be able to hold the [[penis|unwashed tighty-whities]] of their hero. After withdrawing the heaps of cash that his adoring fans willingly shell out, Gay God goes off and buys [[moar]] useless crap and MAC makeup so he can have [[fellatio|makeup parties]] with his friend [[Jeffree Star]] and then posts [[pr0n|teh pix]] on MySpace for more attention. One would assume that the champion of gays and savior of animals would maybe donate a portion of his [[profit|profits]] to AIDS research or animal rights groups, but apparently just standing upon his virtual soapbox and ranting about the former suffices. Saving a lot of [[Lol-cow|cows]] and protecting a lot gays by ranting to a bunch of dysfunctional [[whores|emo girls]] on MySpace really helps the world, Gay God. Thanks.

I even warned you that what I wrote was my own [[shit no one cares about|opinion]]. But whatever, you guys can just be idiotic [[NO_U|meat-eating]] [[heterosexual|homophobes]].

Lush once again proves himself as cum-guzzling hypocritical fagget.

==Facts as Expressed by Gay God==
[[Image:GayGodisapedo!.jpg|thumb|right|Matthew Lush is a [[pedo]]!!!1!]]
*People shouldn't test animals, at all, even if it means we won't discover any future cures for [[AIDS]] or [[PeppermintPatti|cancer]].
*People shouldn't eat animals, because if we do "we're not hip, or with it." and we're probably closet [[Republican|Republicans]]. This quote only proves further that Gay God couldn't care less about animals and only cares about his image on teh interbutts. LOL FAIL.
*You can't be Republican and [[gay]], because if you are, YOU'RE [[Larry Craig|VERY]] [[Ted Haggard|VERY]] WRONG!  
*People shouldn't eat unorganic food, even though food grown in labs is twice the size of any food grown on a farm and could feed entire countries, but Gay God thinks there's something wrong with them.
*Thinks you should starve to show your parents "OMG! I DON'T WANT THAT TASTY FOOD! I'M SERIOUS HERE! SERVE ME UP SUM OF DAT STEAMED VEGETABLES AND TOFU!"
*Thinks he is going to change the world. We're still waiting.
*If you flag me on YouTube U R A HOMOPHOBE!!!!111111
*Stresses the usage of herbal medicines over modern-day pharmaceuticals, when about 100 years ago people thought herbal medicine could be found in conjunction with the physical appearance of a limb; IE a whale looking like your mom, or a tree looking like my penis.
*People in China don't eat babies. ''They eat souls.''  (YA RLY. Just ask the little girl in ''[[japan|The Ring]]''.) 
*Claims he starved, but ironically still radiates gay.  [[LOL WUT|Does not compute]].
*He actually believes that the world is going to end in 2012.

==Memorable Quotes==
* "If you're so fond of the taste of [[cock|flesh]], go eat some [[pussy|babies]] with those other sick fucks in [[China]]."
* "Like seriously, If you're the type of person that goes to [[McDonald's]] everyday... Wow, lets not even go there tubby."
* "[[your mom|My mom]] would cook the meat in the spaghetti sauce, and put chicken broth in the [[power wrist|potatoes]]. Anything to try and get me to eat some form of [[cock|animal]]. And guess what happened? I [[LOL|starved]]."
* "All things like Advil do is hide the problem, If I was you I'd [[suck cock|invest in organic remedies]]. [[Jenkem|Ones]] that have been proven to work for thousands of years that have been covered up by the FDA and [[United States|your lousy ass government]]." <i>(This is especially hilarious because the FDA has no control over herbal medicine by law. So there's no way they'd be able to "cover it up".)</i>
* "We're all meant to be omnivores." ([[wat]]?)
* "I eat [[cock|meat]], Roxy, tell them I eat meat."
* "I AM HAVING SWEET, SWEET BREEDER SEKS WHILE MY LOVER AND I FEED ONE ANOTHER BACON CHEESEBURGERS.  OM NOM NOM NOM!."

==Gay God on stickam.com==
[[Image:Ilegal.jpg|right|thumb|ED is a bastion of illegal activities and home to scum of the Earth, according to the [[fucktards|brilliant legal analysts]] at GayGod's MySpace [[cult|fan group]].]]
In the early days of [[stickam]] Gay God was almost always driven into a private room with him and a mere several dozen of his ever so hip and trendy friends, most of them being /b/tards in disguise looking for lulz. Many times he just left. When stickam placed a "friends only option" in it, it was Gay God's bat signal to return to scene of the crime. But 1337 hax0r /b/tards found a hole in the code that allowed them to breach Gay God's defenses and and spam his room, driving Matty to:
*tears
*calling stickam mods on his cellphone ON CAM
*getting stickam shut down for 5 minutes after reporting "OMG Hax0rs"
*shutting his room almost on any site of "teh h4x0rs"<br>
And the lulz only increase. As he is surrounded by narrow-minded fat chicks who:
*Called for banning of the unbannable hax0rs
*Screaming "GET A LIFE YOU LOSER" (in belief that a group was 1 person, seeing as no more than 1 person could dislike Gay God)
*Crying
*Screaming
*Jiggled their [[fat]] rolls in anger.<br>
This is considered a massive win for the remainder of /b/tards on stickam still harvesting the [[tits]] and lulz.

==Gay God the EBeggar==

Gay God, being the eternal faggot that he is, logged onto stickam, and tried to convince his [[Sheep|fans]] to buy him a new cell phone, in exchange for his cell phone number. Gay God apparently forgot that nobody would really want to talk to him, IRL.

This, of course, ended in a fiery holocaust of fail and bitch, in which Gay God left with a bruised ego, streaming mascara, and no new iphone to play with.

==Breaking news ?==
[[Image:gaygodluvr.jpg|left|thumb|Even his fans want your calls!]]
Gaygod's Stickam has been getting [[over 9000]] hits a week. Unfortunately, too few of those were from [[b|/b/tards]]. He's a [[lulzcow]] waiting to be milked live on webcam. It must be [[troll]]ed [[for great justice]]!

His myspace group is no longer under his control, as he [[fail]]s as an admin, the remaining supporters [[lol-cow]]s and [[scene]] [[whores]].

Apparently the [[retard]]s at [[goatse|homosexual deity]]'s group have gotten wind that [[ED]] is, gasp, an enclave of [[homo]]phobia and h4x0rz. What this means, who knows? It was brought up back in August so those fucktards either did something so minor that it doesn't even matter or they're too busy collectively [[circle jerk|cluster fucking themselves]] to touch Matt's [[AIDS]] encrusted [[penis]].
