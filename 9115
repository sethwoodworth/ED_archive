'''Wolfaboos''' are an odious branch of [[Animal Liberation Front|Animal Rights]] activists and/or [[furfags]] who are to [[wolf|wolves]] what [[13 year old girl]]s are to ''[[Twilight]]''. Wolfaboos think that wolves are quite literally gods of the [[animal]] kingdom, that are going to go extinct any second now, think ''[[anime|Wolf's Rain]]'' was a documentary, think [[Sarah Palin]] is the worst mass murderer since Yahweh, think having a "[[fursona|wolf spirit]]" is unique and daring, ignore all facts and just prattle on about [[ALL CAPS|OMGWOLVES]], and scream at people who disagree or who do not view wolves as the pinnacle of evolution/existence.

Wolves were once [[BAWWWW|one of the most hated animals on the planet]], a trend which was reversed by dedicated biologists who spent [[Basement-dweller|their whole lives]] trying to teach the world the [[truth]] about wolves. Ironically enough, thanks to wolfaboos and their [[furry|mindless fanbase]], the [[DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING|whitewashing]] campaign in defence of wolves has [[fail]]ed miserably, with most people now being [[KILL IT WITH FIRE|sick to death]] of wolves, and seeing wolf hunting as a guaranteed [[lulz]] dispenser.

==Etymology and definition==
[[File:Inner-wolf.png|thumb|]]
Wolf•a•boo [wolf-uh-boo] (n.)

1. A [[Portmanteau|portmanteau]] of [[Weeaboo]] (referring to a person overly obsessed with [[Japan]],) and [[Furry|Wolf]] (a member of the [[science|Canidae family]] and wet dream of every [[furfag]]). A Wolfaboo: ''"A person overly obsessed with wolves; one who equates a human life to that of a wolf; someone who defends and or glorifies wolves killing humans; insists that the wolf is stronger, braver, more compassionate, more noble, more intelligent, etc. than any other animal even when confronted with evidence of the contrary. Is normally an adolescent who subconsciously feels as though he/she needs to have an identity as a wolf or a wolf lover in order to be unique; more often than not has terrible spelling and grammar skills. Often misspelling the plural of wolf as 'wolfs'; Often, will make up lies and propaganda to defend wolves; most of the lies do not hold true when put to actual research. People who specialise in trolling wolfaboos are referred to as "Wolfer-trolls", a compound word derived from Wolfer (a wolf hunter) and [[troll]]"''

Synonyms  include; '''Wolf Fanatics''', '''Wolf Worshipers''', '''Wolftards''', '''Wolf Fappers''' and '''Wolf Fuckers''' (the latter term is unpopular, as it implies that these bozos have actually lost their virginity).

==Why Wolves?==
Why not tigerboos? Why not rhinoboos? Why not pandaboos? It's thought that wolfaboos love wolves for no reason other than they resemble their own pet doggy. That's it. Like most animal rights activists/furfags they only care about pretty animals, not [http://animal-world.com/encyclo/reptiles/spiders/GoliathBirdEatingSpider.php bird-eating spiders big enough to fit over your face]. They do not care which species are going extinct, they care because wolves are so [[awesome]] and [[cool]] and look just like Fido. Dogs as a whole are popular in general because they have inflatable dicks.

But why just wolves? Why not dingoes or jackals? Possibly because wolves were feared and hunted to extinction by humans in many countries, thus wolfaboos often compare them to [[niggers|abused]] [[gays|minorities]]. But like all animal right activists, ultimately, they care more about animals than people.

==Examples of hypocrisy and ignorance==
[[File:Wolfaboo verdict.jpg|thumb|Apparently, wolves can beat tigers, lions and cougars in a fight]]
[[File:Iran-wolf.jpg|thumb|[[Iran|Persian]] depiction of a wolf hunt : Proof that the wolfaboo's claim that people only began hating wolves after the publication of ''Little Red Riding Hood'' is complete bullshit, [[Shit nobody cares about|as Persia is far older than the culture from which the fairy tale originated]]]]

{{quote|Expecting accurate information on wolves from wolfaboos makes about as much sense as asking [[North Korea]]ns for impartial data on their "[[Engrish|gleat reader]]" Kim-Il-Sung|Anoymous}}

*They claim that wolves are needed to keep elk populations down. However, when presented with evidence that wolves drive said elk to extinction, they then claim that wolves have no effect on them after all.

*Wolfaboos claim that hunters kill more deer than wolves do. Britfag wolfaboos however will claim that Scotland’s deer culling programme is ineffective, and wolves (which supposedly do not affect deer populations) are the solution to the overpopulation problem.

*They cite the supposed "friendliness", "loyalty" and "love" of wolf packs as an example for human families to follow. What they overlook is that the breeding pair always eats first at a kill, even during times of famine, thus causing many pups to starve to death. Strangely enough, canines with much less media attention (such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhole dholes] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_dog African wild dogs], which wolfaboos likely don't even know exist) do the exact opposite, and give the pups priority.

*Wolfaboos often claim that they act in defence of all wolves, though all their fanart focuses solely on fat, fluffy North American wolves. You’ll never find art dedicated to Middle-Eastern or Southern Asian wolves, which are the coarse-furred, long eared, small sized animals which first gave rise to the domestic dog and adopted Mowgli.

*They like to think that [[Native American]]s worshipped wolves. History states otherwise: wolves were not elevated above other animals and several tribes killed wolves, either as rites of passage, to make fursuits, or for food. Among other claims, they state that wolves and Natives hunted alongside one another, while writings from the Lewis and Clarke expidition indicate that wolves only occurred outside tribal territorial boundraries.

*They like to compare [[Sarah Palin]] to [[Hitler]] because wild dogs > [[Jews]].

*They often claim that their dog is "part wolf" (see [[Dracoguard]]'s fuck-buddy).

*When it comes to wolf attacks on humans, wolfaboos have a blatant habit of shifting the goalpost.  First they will claim that “There is no record of a wolf ever killing a human”. When it turns out that rabid wolves have killed people, they claim “There is no record of a healthy wolf ever killing a human”. When this itself turns out to be bullshit, due to healthy zoo wolves killing their handlers, they go on to say “There is no record of a wild, healthy wolf ever killing a human”. Finally, when the truth comes out that wild, non-rabid wolves have indeed killed people, they state “There is no record of a wild, healthy, non-habituated wolf ever killing a person” etcetera, ''etcetera''!

*On a similair note, wolfaboos like to post videos or pictures of zoo wolves acting friendly with their handlers, and claim that this is proof that they are harmless. Oddly, people like [[Steve Irwin]], Timothy Treadwell, Kevin Richardson and Kim Wolhuter who befriended dangerous animals (crocodiles, bears, lions and hyenas respectively) never used their specimen's good behavior as proof that their respective animals were not dangerous. Ironically, when captive wolves do kill people, [[hypocrite|the wolfaboos then claim that captive animals are not good examples of wolf behavior after all]].

*They call wolves the “sanitarians of nature”, seemingly unaware of the fact that wolves carry over 50 different parasite species, among them are hydatid tapeworms, which severely weaken game populations. So much for wolves keeping the herds strong!

*Although wolfaboos claim that wolves would never attack a person, and that their reputation for killing large, healthy animals is unjustified, they think that wolves can beat far stronger predators such as hyenas, cougars, lions and tigers in a fight. This is odd, as they also claim that mere livestock guardian dogs are a foolproof way of repelling wolves from livestock.

*Being largely urban, pastey skinned teenagers with no experience whatsoever in manual work, wolfaboos naturally like to lecture rural people on how to run their farms, citing a miriad of [[batshit|non-lethal]] methods of keeping wolves away from their property.

*They genuinely believe that wolves only kill for food. They've obviously never heard of "surplus killing".

*Most wolfaboos (particularly the [[emo]] types) pick black colored wolves as their [[fursona]]s, as if unaware that [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/science/06wolves.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper black wolves are actually wolf-dog crossbreeds], and are thus the least "wolf-like" color variant.

*They actually believe that Balto (the [[IRL]] huskie, not the cartoon) was a wolf-dog hybrid.

==Subspecies==
Like the animal which they masturbate to, wolfaboos come in many different forms, sizes and levels of dumbfuckery:

*'''DeviantArt wolfaboos''': Famous for their efforts at increasing wolf awareness through drawing [[sparkledog]]s and [[yiff]], as well as ruining perfectly good fictional characters by re-drawing them as wolves
*'''Furry Affinity wolfaboos''': Known for their unambiguous desire to [[bukkake]] wolves
*'''Iscribble Wolfaboos''': Seem to be  hybrid populations between the FA and DA wolfaboos
*'''Yahoo Answer wolfaboos''': Suffice to say, they know nothing about wolves
*'''Youtube wolfaboos''': Arguably the stupidest of them all. When they are not typing ''SAVE TEH WOLFS!!!!'' or ''HUNTERZ SUK!1!1!'' on other people's comment pages, these exceptionally annoying little faggots have the habit of ripping stock footage from ''Wolf's Rain'' or ''Balto'', then using them to make "music videos" in which (being the talentless hacks they are) they basically take someone elses song and try to make it apply to wolves.

===Wolfaboo Stamps===
There are three types of wolfaboo stamps:
*Anti-wolfaboo but pro-wolf ("I love wolves but I'm NOT a wolfaboo!")
*Anti-wolfaboo and anti-wolf ("Fuck wolves! What about the Goliath Bird-eating Spider?!")
*Pro-wolfaboo with no mention of wolves whatsoever ("Wolf H8ers SUUUUUUUCK!!1!").

==[[Faggots|Wolfaboo role models]]==
[[File:Wolfabooyiff.jpg|thumb|Ellis and Mowat discuss the future of wolves]]

*'''[[WolfAdvocate]]:''' Classic example of a pseudo-intellectual defender of wolves made even more pathetic by the fact he looks 12 rather than 21 and has [[aspergers syndrome]]. Driven off both [[youtube]] and [[deviantart]] after gently being told wolves aren't the most important species on the planet. Interestingly he comes from [[Australia]] - the land of dingoes, not wolves.

*'''[[Hatedwerewolf]]:''' No description needed.

*'''Farley Mowat:''' The [[creationism|Kent Hovind]] of wolves. Most famous for his fictional book (marketed as an [[lie|autobiography]]) ''Never Cry Wolf'', this [[Unwarranted self importance|self-aggrandising]] [[Canada|Canadian]] portrays wolves as fox-loving lemming eaters who only kill caribou in desperation. Wolfaboos lap this up like the wolf cum they dream of having jizzed on their faces, seemingly unaware that their idol is [[Venomfangx|a proven self-aggrandising compulsive liar]], known to Canadian natives as “hardly-know-it” and [[copypasta|a serial plagiarist]] of works done by actual wolf biologists.

*'''[[Shaun Ellis]]:''' A [[British]] closet [[biofur]] and ex-marine (oddly resembling a chunkier version of [[Wolfeedarkfang]]), known as "The Wolfman", who abandoned his family and his regiment in order to fulfil his lifelong dream of living in a zoo eating deer entrails with captive wolves, [[bestiality|among other things]].

*'''Misha Defonseka:''' A [[catholic]] [[Belgium|Belgian]] wolfaboo whose real name is '''Monique De Wael''', as well as being the daughter of a [[Nazi]] collaborating traitor. She obviously took a shine to Farley Mowat's con-job, and wrote an "[[lie|autobiography]]" entitled ''Surviving with Wolves'', in which she describes herself as a Jew escaping from Nazi captivity as a child, and surviving in the wilderness for two seasons with a wolf pack. Naturally, her conscience soon got the better of her, and she later admitted to all her wolfaboo fangirls that the whole story was total bullshit (conveniently after making £10 m from sales).

*'''Ashley Judd:''' An ex-ham actress from [[california]] and spokesperson of [[PETA|Defenders of Wildlife]], who BAWWWs over Sarah Palin's Alaskan wolf management policies.

*'''Mike Wagner''' a.k.a '''PWI''' (Posterboy for Wolfaboo Insanity): The sociopathic founder of [http://www.heartofthewolf.org/ Heart of the Wolf], who anthropomorphises wolves to the extent of [http://www.heartofthewolf.org/HoWOWolfNewsUpdate5152009.html comparing wolf hunting to the holocaust], and calls Shaun Ellis, as well as actual qualified wolf biologists, "[http://www.heartofthewolf.org/Murderers.htm wolf murderers]". His counterarguments against the responsible management of wolf populations by qualified biologists typically involve ad-hominem attacks and (wait for it) quotes from ''[[The X Files]]''. Among other things, he thinks that [http://www.heartofthewolf.org/DisneyEvil.htm Disney films] and the [http://www.heartofthewolf.org/Narnia.htm Chronicles of Narnia] are part of a "conspiracy" to demonise wolves

and finally...

*'''[[Adolf Hitler]]''': [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S6jKVfuQG3wC&pg=PA70&dq=hitler+wolves&hl=en&ei=HOLGTLSNCYbMswbeyrj7DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hitler%20wolves&f=false Yes], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T5aN5S6AhXQC&pg=PA77&dq=hitler+wolves&hl=en&ei=duLGTMv8KYGTswaG1ZiLDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hitler%20wolves&f=false he] [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_4BVWXNcNJoC&pg=PA100&dq=hitler+wolves&hl=en&ei=duLGTMv8KYGTswaG1ZiLDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=hitler%20wolves&f=false was] [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2eiuRvHN7RAC&pg=PA95&dq=hitler+wolves&hl=en&ei=B-PGTOnhB4HBswasseHjDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&q=hitler%20wolves&f=false a wolfaboo] [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y3Gr7qTarfIC&pg=PA272&dq=nazis+introduced+first+legislation+for+the+protection+of+wolves&hl=en&ei=iuPGTMTzLsj3sgaZj6z2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=nazis%20introduced%20first%20legislation%20for%20the%20protection%20of%20wolves&f=false too]. The final link should raise a few eyebrows, considering that wolfaboos like to compare Hitler to those who hate wolves or call for the delisting of wolves from the ESA.

|"Hey a**hole,

That was a lovely letter you sent to the wolf organization I am a member of. You know what, F**K YOU! If you hate wolves so much then you get out of this [[America|country]] and go to a country where wolves are not a native species you [[redneck]] [[faggot]]! You anti wolf rednecks are nothing more than [[NO U|fascist nazis]] because you make up only 25% of this nations population and yet you try to dictate to the rest of us! [[Terrorist|We will fight for wolves until we are put in the ground mother f**ker!]] Anyway, why don't you anti wolf morons just shut the f**k up and stop tryng to get any excuse to mess with wolves. Don't you people have a life? Don't you rednecks have a clan meeting to go to? It is obvious none of you know how things work. Wolves were reintroduced because the majority of [[basement dweller|Americans]] wanted it. Wolves will also remain protected because the majority of Americans want it that way despite that peice of s**t [[George Bush]] and our hypocritical government of buerocracy.We will get the delisting overturned! Its not all about a few ignorant and shallow individuals such as yourselves.I also guerantee sometime in this century, trophy hunting will be banned alltogether aswell because thats the way the majority of Americans would prefer it.Besides, trophy hunting is for anyone who is disturbed and sadistic and is probably compensating for a lack of something.Plus, anyone who decorates their homes with dead animal corpses is just a few steps short of being like Jeffery Dahmer in my opinion. The only reason why you people want to kill wolves is because you want to artificially boost deer and elk populations for yourselves and if thats the case, then trophy hunting needs to be outlawed in this country. Also, the right to bear arms and hunting are two total different things. It is the trophy hunters who are depleting the deer and elk population.[[lie|Wolves hunt to survive]]. Most humans hunt just to kill and take far more deer and elk than the wolves ever will. Leave the herbavores to the natural predators. Hunting is no longer essential to human survival. Trophy hunting is also animal cruelty and should be banned outright. Besides, if we are going to allow trophy hunting then we might aswell pardon people like Michael Vick, and allow dogfighting. Its causing an animal pain and suffering for fun so its no better than the other. Just because it is not a domestic animal, does not make trophy hunting right. I say ban all trophy hunting along with anything else people do that is inhumane and cruel. The majority of Americans are pro wolf and you people are not going to get your way because we will do everything in our power to stop you.I hate to give all of you a reality check and pull your heads out of your a**es, but thats how it is.[[Unwarranted self importance|By the way, I am getting a college education studying law and politics]].Among the causes I will devote my life to after college, will be [[fap|defending]] wolves. All the things you people say about wolves is a crock of s**t and the majority of people in this country know it.If you people don't like it, then get out this country and move to a country that doesn't have wolves and where wolves are not a native species. Modern America doesn't wan't you people in it anyway. You can go ahead and get mad and attack all you want but I know what the truth is and I will not apologize for standing up for wolves and wildlife.That is because I know for a fact just how disgusting,corrupt,cruel,and inhumane cowboys and rednecks are over their own personal greed. Horses kill more people than wolves ever have or will. [[bullshit|In fact, there are no authentic documented cases of healthy wolves attacking humans in America]]. So live and let live.I know for a fact that wolves are not what ranchers or you ignorant people try to make them out to be because [[idiot|I had a wolf hybrid as a pet]] when I was a teenager.I had a great grandfather who rescued a wolf pup from ignorant people such as yourselves, and raised it. That wolf was his favorite [[bestiality|animal companion]]. I have also studied about wolves from every book and article I could find. I have books that go as far back as the 1950s when scientists began studying wolves and people started fighting to protect them, I also volunteer at a wolf rescue and sanctuary to escape where I have to live so you will never brainwash me from what I already know is the truth. I will not quietly let something I love be destroyed over greed. This might strike a nerve with the ranching industry but I am going to say it anyway. As a consumer, I get a choice whether or not tuna is dolphin safe but not whether or not my steak is wolf, bear, or cougar safe? Thats not cool! Anyway, I don't care what some greedy ranchers or morons like you people think! [[internet tough guy|I will fight for wolves and wildlife and any other passion that I have until I am put in the ground]]. Tell Butch Otter I said for him to shut his f**king mouth and join Senetor Larry Craig in the men's room! To all of you anti wolf morons; F**K YOU!!!"

|Nobody owns a wolf or wolfdog unless they're a wolfaboo, desperate to be cool, or have a small penis. Even worse are the youtube videos of their wolves doing cute and funny things or videos of wolf puppies. Just stop it, you're encouraging people to go out and buy them from skeezy brokers like those batshit breeders in Texas. All while not doing research. And people wonder why their wolves tear their faces off. Here's a hint; THEY'RE WILD FUCKING ANIMALS. When you do things that piss them off, they will strike back. That's how animals work, and wild animals have even LESS restraint than a domesticated one.

|we humans created the next step of canine evolution.
seriously, dogs are better than wolves in everything.

|Shaun Ellis has nothing to teach a wolf. He cannot teach them how to hunt, he cannot teach them how to have sex, and he cannot teach them how to seriously fight among themselves. Think about it. Ellis is too slow to chase down a rabbit. More to the point, the wolves do not have near enough room to run down a deer or elk on their own (not that there are any elk in the U.K.). So what does Ellis "teach" the wolves to do instead? He teaches them to ... wait for it ... fish with a few mackeral and trout he steals from the seal exhibit next door. Oh goodie! Talk about Through the Looking Glass.

|''"I like wolves as much as the next guy, but it is kind of ridiculous how romanticisized and over hyped they can be. I will join you in dissecting some of these arguments, lol ^^...from the perspective of a biological science major, with a desire to be a veterinarian.
Yep, [[stupid|they arent THAT smart]]. Sure, as far as animals go, wolves are slightly above average...but Dolphins, cephalapods, and cetaceans as a group, pigs (who's intelligence is often overlooked), Elephants, primates, and some birds are, in fact smarter. Pack behavior should not be assumed to be intelligence. A lot of that is imitation and instinct.
You're completely right about a wolf's strength. A human who stays alert, and is armed with a large enough stick or blunt object, could probably keep at least two wolves at bay for a bit. Wolves are built for speed and endurance, not strength. Some domestic dogs are much larger and/or physically stronger than woles (Rottwilers, Pitbulls, etc).

Fighting a TIGER is like fighting a tiger. A wolf is what, about 5-6ft long and maybe 80-110 pounds (I might be being generous with that size too)...and full grown Siberian Tiger is about 10 to 12ft and between 500 and 700 pounds in weight. Its like comparing a middle school kid...to Mike Tyson.
[[Coward|Wolves hunt in packs]] because they arent very strong individually. That is the purpose of most group behavior. Sure, you have exceptions, like a pride of [[lion]]s...but in general, a group is used to compensate for the lesser strength of its individual parts.
"[[ALL CAPS|WOLVES ARE WAY SMARTER THAN YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]" ...that deserves yet another facepalm. If a wolf is way smarter than you...[[retard|you have problems]]. Dont mistake group behavior for intelligence. [[Lemmings]] live in groups, but they will follow other members of their group off a cliff without a second thought (YES, lemmings are real animal, people. lol. look it up). As I said earlier, wolves are slightly above average...but not anything to make any big deal about, as far as animals go. Now, cephalapods...there's some intelligence in that group of animals."''

*State that wolves are overrated
*State that wolves are not endangered, and that wolves hog the limelight of animals more deserving of attention and protection
*State that you support wolf hunting
*State that you support aerial wolf shooting
*State that you do not support aerial wolf shooting, then go on to say that you miss the bygone days when wolves could be poisoned en masse or chased and torn apart with dogs
*State that you support clubbing wolf pups
*State that you collect wolf pelts
*State on a wolf forum that you loved ''The Chronicles of Narnia'', and that your favourite scene was when Peter skewers the wolf
*Same as above, only replace ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' with ''The Day after Tomorrow''
*Tell them that having a "spirit wolf" is not unique, daring or special considering that 75% of all selected spirit animals ''are'' wolves
*State that ''Balto'' and/or ''Wolf's Rain'' were [[truth|crap]]
*Mention "surplus killing" when they state that wolves only kill for food
*Ask for wolf-meat recipes
*Play as a hunter, rancher or wolfhound in a wolf RP
*If you're into ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', then tell them that the worgen are a pointless race with no folkloric basis, made only to market to the wolfaboo's idiotic fanbase, and mention that when playing the game, you habitually skin wolves and sell their pelts
*Say that you support Sarah Palin
*Tell them that [[truth|poodles are cooler]] and more majestic
*Tell them that their dog is quite obviously NOT part wolf
*State that people who keep wolves or wolf hybrids as pets are morons
*Quote from [http://ia341317.us.archive.org/3/items/wolfcoyotetrappi00hard/wolfcoyotetrappi00hard.pdf this book] on trapping and hunting wolves
*Tell them that Golden Eagles ruin wolves, then prove it by showing them this:

*[[TL;DR]], just say ANYTHING negative about wolves

==Wolfaboo jokes==

: '''Q.''' What did the wolfaboo say to the wolf?
: '''A.''' Nothing, the wolf bit his head off before he could speak.

: '''Q.''' Why did the wolf cross the road?
: '''A.''' Because there were no wolfaboos on the other side

: '''Q.''' Why didn't the three little pigs have a sequel?
: '''A.''' They were slaughtered by a mob of wolfaboos.

: '''Q.'''Why do wolfaboos claim that wolves are endangered, despite the proof in the ESA?
: '''A.''' They "don't know who ESA is" (see [http://encyclopediadramatica.com/File:I_dont_know_ESA.png here] if you don't get it)

: '''Q.''' Why did the ''Balto'' series end so quickly?
: '''A.''' Balto was ashamed, so he quit.

: '''Q.''' What gets automatically tainted forever as soon as the eyes of a wolfaboo lay on it? 
: '''A.''' Any form of entertainment involving wolves

: '''Q.''' What happened to little red riding hood?
: '''A.''' She spent the rest of her life hiding..... From the raging wolfaboos

: Anonymous was visiting the zoo when he came across the wolf exhibit. He was rather disappointed, as there was only one, rather sickly looking wolf licking its rectum. When he told the keeper this, he was reassured that the wolf was in fact quite ferocious, and in peak condition just an hour ago when some crazed wolf fan had jumped the fence, been torn to shreds and messily devoured. 'If that's so' Anonymous asked, 'why is he just sitting there licking his rear?'... '''Poor thing can't get the taste out of his mouth.'''
