Everybody knows what a great place the '''Play Area''' (also known as "The Play Place," or "The Big Toy") of your local fast food restaurant is for picking up hot chicks, but did you know that now, most of those Play Areas have free [[WiFi]] access?  It’s true, so now not only can you check out the babes, you can also check out your email, your [[Facebook]], and even [[pornography]]!

==The Incident==

On Sunday, June 27, several children were playing in their neighborhood McDonald’s play area.  Parents were nearby, chatting amongst themselves, and so were many other patrons of the hamburger restaurant.  Also, Michael Baumgartner was there, checking out some hot naked chicks on his laptop.  Concerned parents noticed that Mr. Baumgartner did not appear to have any children of his own while he was using his laptop right next to the restaurant’s Play Area, so they examined the lone man a little more closely.  What they found shocked and appalled them, as Mr. Baumgartner was viewing pornography right there, next to their 15-20 darling children.  He also appeared to be fondling himself.

Naturally police were contacted.

==The Arrest==

Upon their arrival, Madison, Wisconsin police officers noticed that Mr. Baumgartner was busy fondling himself near to where the children were playing.  They immediately made an arrest for lewd and lascivious behavior.  Upon his apprehension, Mr. Baumgartner agreed with the police officers that his actions were “probably not in good judgment.”

Ronald McDonald was unavailable for comment.
