Rosie O'Donnell
[[Image:Rosie'sfat.jpg|thumb|Photo taken from a photo shoot where Rosie models for XXXXXXXXXL sized clothes.]]

'''Rosie O'Donnell''' is a fat, unattractive bull dyke "comedienne" with a <s>mouth</s> anus the size of [[Alaska]].  S/he has recently become a celebrity [[blog]]ger after offering her insightful and [[shit no one cares about|educated opinion]] on various talk shows and subsequently being fired.

In her spare time, s/he enjoys ramming dildos up her ass. Her ass is reamed out due to the frequency that she "rams." She is now forced to use larger items such as Pine Mountain logs or [[Quasidan's penis|Renée Zellweger's cock]]. 

Rosie is the kind of person that would push a guy in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs, and laugh at him because she is a [[feminazi]]. S/he supports the legalization of adult sexual contact with [[children]], abortions at any stage of pregnancy, gay-marriages, and child-pornography, because they are all "civil rights."

== The Rosie Loophole ==
[[Rule 34]] clearly states that "'''if it exists, there is [[shoop|porn]] of it.'''" Furthermoar, Rule 35 states that if said [[pr0n]] cannot be found it must be created.

Howevar, despite the '''NO EXCEPTIONS''' clause, [[anon]] will [[DO NOT WANT|refuse]] when '''"[[34]] on Rosie"''' is called. Technically, this is not breaking [[The Rules Of The Internet]] because [[anon]] is not denying that Rosie 34 exists, nor that it can be created. Like [[Army|draft dodging]] conscientious [[coward|objectors]], they simply [[NO U|refuse]] to find, create and/or upload it.

== Rosie O'Donnell and [[Donald Trump]] ==
[[Image:Rosiedonald.jpg|thumb|The Donald proves that you '''can''' [[trolls trolling trolls|troll a troll]].]]
Rosie is currently in an ongoing [[flame war|feud]] with [[troll|Donald Trump]] and, as of [[Last Thursday|last Thursday]], is being sued by Trump for defamation of character; believe it or not, [[TOW]] is to blame. <sup title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs citation." class="noprint">&#91;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources|''citation&nbsp;needed'']]&#93;</sup>

You see, one night the naive, rotund Rosie [[Google|the Googled]] "[[The Donald]]" for flame ammo and ended up with a bunch of [[lies|half-truths]] from his bio on [[Wikipedia]]. The next day on her TV show, '''"The View"''', she went on a butthurt tirade, flaming Trump with TOW '[[fact]]s' including stating that Trump is financially bankrupt (which he isn't).

In retaliation The Donald [[troll|fired back]] with a [[lollercaust]] of insults and a [[lawsuit]] to relieve her lard-arse of all her money and bankrupt <i>her</i>; so in effect, [[TOW]] [[pwned]] that fat bitch.

== [[racist|Chinese Jokes]] ==

Like all lesbians, O'Donnell hates the [[china|Chinese]] and regularly pokes fun at [[Chink]]s.

Sadly her grasp on English is worse than that of the average chink leading to much lulz.

Rosie has fucking lost it. Her blog has gone from arch-libtard all the way to something that can only be described as [[Fucktarded|"anti thought"]].

Consider this [[Shit|nugget]]:

Here is her harrowing account of W's plan to kill this rising star:

{{Squote|"President Bush almost killed me. It's true, and I have the scars to prove it — multiple scars that are part of the public record — you saw them in magazines and on my show, and you can see them on my blog frequently — no twelve year wait required. 

It was 2000, and the Republican National Convention was on television. The whole affair felt something like a home invasion, with a chronically smirking and arrogant George W. Bush as ringleader. Not wishing to be robbed of my optimism and hope at the time — or to tumble into depression and despair — I shut off the TV and decided to go fishing.

I needed gear, so I went to the store and bought a few things, including a knife, which I used to cut the price tags off of the fishing poles. 

Now, I could have stabbed myself 100 times in the hand and not managed to do the damage I did with that one poke to the inside of my middle finger. I went all out, though, and got everything — skin, ligaments, tendons, nerves. Maximum impact, including a particularly nasty staph infection that almost left me dead".|Crazy bitch|She stabs herself after watching the RNC, thus [[W]] is to blame.}}
